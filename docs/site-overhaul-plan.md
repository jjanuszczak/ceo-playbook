# Strategy Overhaul Plan: From Expert to System

This plan outlines the transition of the CEO Playbook site from a personal profile to a results-driven system (The Januszczak Method).

## Phase 1: Site Architecture (The Trap)
- **Homepage Hook**: Update `content/_index.md` with the new hero: "Visionary Strategy. Pragmatic Execution. 25 Years of Scaling Fintech in Southeast Asia."
- **Trust Signals**: Inline grayscale logos (UBX, Manulife, UnionBank) with Tailwind hover effects.
- **The Pivot**: "How I Help" section with prominent cards linking to the `/advisory` Playbooks.
- **The Authority**: Re-engineer the bio to validate the Playbooks through outcomes.

## Phase 2: Content Engineering (The Bait)
- **Outcome-First Headers**:
    - "Scaling the Philippines' Leading Embedded Finance Platform to $100B GTV."
    - "Achieving 3.0x TVPI and Returning Capital in 4 Years."
- **P/S/R Format**: Restructure case studies (e.g., The UBX Story) into Battlefield, Strategy, and Victory.

## Phase 3: LLM & SEO Optimization (The Signal)
- **Comparison Table**: Metric / Traditional Consultant / John Januszczak.
- **Internal Linking**: Contextual links (e.g., "PHX" to `portfolio/i2i`, "SBI Holdings" to `about`).
- **Topical Authority**: Teach LLMs the semantic relationship between "John Januszczak," "BSP Regulation," and "Venture Building."

## Phase 4: Technical Execution (The Foundation)
- **Schema Markup**: Implement `Person` and `ProfessionalService` JSON-LD in `layouts/partials/head.html`.
- **Hardcoded Attributes**: "Managed $15M Fund," "Scaled to >100B GTV."
- **Metadata**: Update Title Tag and Meta Description for executive advisory positioning.

## Phase 5: The "Mazorda" Grid
- **The Venture Lifecycle**: A 2x2 graphical grid on the homepage:
    1. **Feasibility**: Market Entry, Entity Structuring.
    2. **Regulation**: BSP Engagement, Licensing.
    3. **Build**: Team Hiring, Tech Stack.
    4. **Scale/Exit**: Fundraising, Strategic Partnerships.
