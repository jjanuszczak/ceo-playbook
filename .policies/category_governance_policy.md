# Category Governance Policy

This document establishes the official taxonomy for site categories. It is based on [Issue #1](https://github.com/jjanuszczak/ceo-playbook/issues/1).

## Design Principles

1.  **Categories describe *your role*, not the topic.**
2.  **Categories should age slowly; tags absorb change.**
3.  **Categories should feel intentional, not exhaustive.**
4.  **Each post usually has exactly one category.**
5.  **If a category doesn’t sound good in a nav bar, kill it.**

## Approved Core Categories

The following list comprises the **only** allowed categories for this site.

| Category | Description | Typical Reader | Longevity |
