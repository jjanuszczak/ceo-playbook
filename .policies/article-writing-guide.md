# Writing a great Article

## 1\. Start with a clear purpose

Before you write a single sentence, answer:

* What do I want the reader to think, feel, or do after reading this?  
* Who is this actually for?

A strong purpose keeps you focused and will help the words flow easily.

## 2\. Nail the title (and hook)

Great titles are specific, spark curiosity, and promise value. Pair that with a strong first sentence to hook the reader and ease them into your story.

**Bad**: “Tips for Better Productivity in 2026” 

**Good**: “Why 95% of Productivity Advice Fails”

Your header image also plays a key role in enticing the reader to open your Article. Make sure it’s visually appealing and relevant to the topic of your content.

## 3\. Structure for skimmability

People skim before they read, especially on mobile where most users access X. Make it impossible to miss the value:

* Use short paragraphs (2-4 lines max)  
* Include subheadings every 3-5 paragraphs  
* Bullets and numbered lists \> walls of text  
* Bold the key insight in almost every section  
* Stick to one idea per paragraph

## 4\. Develop a natural, recognizable voice

Whether analytical, spicy, or conversational, consistency in tone helps readers feel like they know you when they come back. The moment writing becomes too “professional” it usually becomes boring. Write like you’re talking to a good friend, not a lecture hall. Use “you,” “your,” and other conversational language.

**Bad**: “Successful people always prioritize their tasks.”

**Good**: “You need to stop doing everything — focus on the 3 things that actually move the needle.”

## 5\. Show, don’t just tell

Facts and data are great, but stories and examples make them stick. For any claim you make, follow it immediately with evidence of why it’s true (stats, personal story, before/after, etc.). You can even embed your own X posts or Articles as living examples.

## 6\. Edit ruthlessly

The first draft is for you. The second (and third) draft is for the reader.

After writing:

* Cut 20-30% of the word count  
* Remove filler phrases like “very,” “really,” or “in order to”  
* Read the whole thing out loud — awkward sentences will jump out

## 7\. Add visuals and formatting

Images, screenshots, charts, or even embedded X posts help break up text and make your Article more shareable. Well-formatted Articles with bold headers, spacing, and images get way more engagement.

## 8\. End with a strong close

Don’t just fade out — close with energy and give the reader a takeaway or call to action.

* Summarize the key points  
* Ask a question to spark replies  
* Encourage them to share or try one tip right now
