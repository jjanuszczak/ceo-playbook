### The Trap vs. The Playbook

| The Trap (Corporate Innovation) | The Januszczak Playbook (Venture Scaling) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus:** "Digital Transformation" buzzwords. | **Focus:** Creating standalone entities with P&L accountability. |
| **Speed:** Slowed by parent company compliance. | **Speed:** Agile governance structures that bypass bureaucracy. |
| **Talent:** Retrained bank staff. | **Talent:** Recruiting net-new tech DNA incentivized by mission & equity. |
| **Outcome:** A nice app with low usage. | **Outcome:** 22% Market Share & Strategic Exits. |

## The "Zero-to-Scale" Framework

I do not sell theory. I deploy a battle-tested framework used to build the Philippines' leading embedded finance platform.

**1. Structure for Independence**
We design the legal entity to protect the parent company’s license while allowing the venture to move at startup speed. This includes setting up the right governance to balance "bank grade" security with "fintech" agility.

**2. The "Talent Magnet" Strategy**
Top-tier tech talent will not work for a traditional bank salary structure. I help you structure equity/phantom stock pools and culture that attract the builders you need.

**3. Regulatory Alignment (Day 1)**
We engage regulators early, turning compliance from a blocker into a competitive moat. *See my [Regulatory Playbook](/advisory/market-entry-strategic-structuring) for details.*

## Proof of Concept: The UBX Story

*Most advisors have read about venture building. I have done it.*

**The Challenge:** Traditional banking was losing ground to agile fintech disruptors. We needed a way to capture the embedded finance market without putting the parent bank's core systems at risk.

**The Execution:**
* Founded **UBX** as a separate entity from UnionBank.
* Aggressively hired non-traditional banking talent.
* Focused entirely on **[embedded finance]({{< ref "articles/future-of-finance" >}})** (Open Finance) ecosystems.

**The Outcomes (Hard Data):**
* **Scale:** Grew from zero to **>100B GTV**.
* **Dominance:** Captured **22% Market Share** in our niche.
* **Sustainability:** Delivered **6 consecutive years** of revenue growth.
* **Validation:** Secured strategic investment from **[SBI Holdings (Japan)]({{< ref "about" >}})**.

### De-Risk Your Execution

Most innovation initiatives fail not because of bad ideas, but because of a disconnect between strategy and execution. Large consulting firms observe the market; I have shaped it. Compare the standard advisory approach against the Januszczak Operating System.

| Feature | Large Consulting Firm | John Januszczak |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deliverable** | 100-Slide PowerPoints | **Live Operating Entities** |
| **Skin in Game** | Hourly/Project Fees | **Reputation & Outcome Focused** |
| **Experience** | Observed from the sidelines | **Sat in the CEO Seat (UBX)** |
| **Network** | General Database | **Direct Line to Regional Regulators & Investors** |
