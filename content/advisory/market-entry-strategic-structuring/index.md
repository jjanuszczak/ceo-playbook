### The Trap vs. The Playbook

| The Trap (Standard Legal Counsel) | The Januszczak Playbook (Regulatory Strategy) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Approach:** Citing the black-and-white letter of the law. | **Approach:** Navigating the "grey areas" via direct regulator dialogue. |
| **Output:** A 50-page "Legal Opinion" warning of risks. | **Output:** A roadmap to "Yes" and a structured entity. |
| **Speed:** Months of back-and-forth paperwork. | **Speed:** Accelerated approval via established credibility. |
| **Focus:** Compliance only. | **Focus:** Compliance + Commercial Viability. |

## The "Regulatory Navigator" Protocol

Most market entrants fail in the Philippines because they treat regulation as a checklist. I treat it as a relationship.

**1. Feasibility & Structure (The "Go/No-Go")**
Before you spend a dollar on lawyers, we assess if your business model will survive local regulation. I help you [structure your local entity]({{< ref "advisory/venture-building" >}}) (OPC, Subsidiary, JV) to maximize control while satisfying foreign ownership restrictions.

**2. The Sandbox Strategy**
Don't wait for a full license to start testing. I guide you through the **[Regulatory Sandboxes](https://www.bsp.gov.ph)**, allowing you to launch a pilot, gather data, and prove your model to regulators in a controlled environment.

**3. Commercial Deal Structuring (JVs & M&A)**
Market entry in the Philippines often requires a local partner. This is where most foreign firms lose value: they sign standard templates that favor the local conglomerate.

* **The CVC Advantage:** Leveraging my experience managing a top decile fund and achieving 3.0x returns, I structure deals that protect your cap table and governance rights.
* **Joint Venture Architecture:** I design the shareholders' agreement (SHA) to ensure you retain operational control, IP rights, and a clear path to exit, even if you are the minority shareholder on paper.
* **Valuation & Terms:** I don't just accept the "market rate." I help you negotiate valuation, liquidation preferences, and board seats to ensure the partnership remains commercially viable for the long term.

**4. The "Trust" Bridge**
Regulators approve people, not just papers. I bridge the gap between "Silicon Valley Tech Speak" and "Central Bank Risk Language," ensuring regulators understand your innovation is safe, stable, and beneficial.

## Proof of Concept: The First Bank-Backed Stablecoin (PHX)

*I don't just advise on crypto regulation. I helped write the rulebook.*

**The Challenge:** Launching a blockchain-based stablecoin aimed at rural banks—a product that had no clear regulatory precedent in the Philippines.

**The Execution:**
* Engaged the BSP *before* the build, framing the technology as "financial inclusion" rather than "disruption."
* Designed the **[PHX]({{< ref "portfolio/i2i" >}})** token architecture to mirror existing e-money circulars.
* Secured the necessary notifications and approvals to hold the fiat backing.

**The Outcomes:**
* **First Mover:** Successfully launched **PHX**, the first BSP-approved stablecoin.
* **Open Finance:** Laid the groundwork for the Philippines' Open Finance framework.
* **Legacy:** Established a regulatory template now used by subsequent fintech entrants.

### The Operator Advantage

You don't need another theory on how fintech works; you need a navigator who has actually built one. My advisory model is designed to bridge the gap between high-level strategy and the messy reality of regulatory execution. Stop paying for 'best practices' and start paying for proven results.

| Feature | International Law Firm | Investment Broker | John Januszczak |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Focus** | Legal Compliance | Closing the Transaction | **Long-Term Commercial Viability** |
| **Structuring** | Standard Templates | Maximizing Fee % | **Optimizing Control & Governance** |
| **Experience** | Drafted Contracts | Sold Companies | **Built & Managed a CVC Fund** |
| **Outcome** | A Registered Entity | A Signed Deal | **A De-risked Operating Partner** |
