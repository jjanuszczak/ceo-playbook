# Stop Doing "Innovation Theater." <span class="text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400">Start Building Assets</span>.

{{< lead >}}
Most corporate innovation labs are cost centers disguised as R&D. I help large enterprises build [Venture Studios]({{< ref "advisory/venture-building" >}}) and CVC funds that actually return capital and strategic value.

### The Trap vs. The Playbook

| The Trap (The "Innovation Lab") | The Januszczak Playbook (Asset Creation) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Metric:** Number of "Ideas generated" or Hackathons run. | **Metric:** **DPI (Distributions to Paid-In Capital) & TVPI.** |
| **Talent:** Internal managers "rotated" into innovation. | **Talent:** Founders and Builders incentivized by **Phantom Stock/Carry.** |
| **Governance:** Suffocated by parent company procurement. | **Governance:** Ring-fenced "Skunkworks" with independent decision rights. |
| **Outcome:** A cool demo that never scales. | **Outcome:** **3.0x Returns** and defensible market share. |

## The "P&L" Innovation Framework

Innovation without a P&L is just a hobby. I deploy the same rigorous capital allocation framework used to manage [UnionBank’s successful CVC arm]({{< ref "about" >}}).

**1. The CVC Engine (Corporate Venture Capital)**
We don't just "invest in startups." We structure a fund with a clear thesis: Financial Returns first, Strategic Fit second. If the unit economics don't work, the strategic value is a mirage.

**2. The "Skunkworks" Separation**
You cannot disrupt your business model from inside the building. I help you design the legal and operational air-gap between the "Mothership" (the core business) and the "Speedboats" (the ventures), protecting the parent brand while unleashing the startup.

**3. The Exit Strategy (Begin with the End)**
Most corps never plan the exit. We define the success metrics on Day 1: Do we spin this out? Do we fold it back in? Do we sell it? This discipline forces distinct operational milestones.

## Proof of Concept: The UnionBank CVC Fund

*While others wrote whitepapers on "Future of Banking," we deployed capital.*

**The Challenge:** The bank needed exposure to emerging fintech models without diluting focus on core banking operations.

**The Execution:**
* Established a multi-million dollar **Corporate Venture Capital Fund**.
* Implemented a strict investment committee structure separate from bank credit committees.
* Focused on "High-conviction" bets rather than "Spray and pray."

**The Outcomes (Auditable Results):**
* **Returns:** Achieved **3.0x TVPI** (Total Value to Paid-In Capital).
* **Liquidity:** Delivered **1.05x DPI**, returning the entire principal to the bank in just **four years**.
* **Integration:** Successful technology transfer from portfolio companies back to the parent bank.

### Beyond Innovation Theater

Stop collecting sticky notes. Start building assets. While traditional consultants focus on process, I focus on P&L. Here is the difference:

| Feature | Management Consultant | John Januszczak |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Focus** | Culture & Workshops | **Cap Tables & P&L** |
| **Risk Appetite** | None (Advice only) | **Investor Mindset (Managed $15M)** |
| **Track Record** | "Helped launch a lab" | **Returned Capital (Paid back the Principal)** |
| **Method** | Design Thinking Post-its | **Investment Committee Rigor** |
| **Speed** | 6-month Strategy Phase | **Day 1: Deal Flow & Structuring** |

## Is Your Innovation Budget a Donation?

If you are spending millions on "Digital Transformation" but cannot point to a new revenue line or a successful exit, your governance is broken. Let’s fix the structure.
