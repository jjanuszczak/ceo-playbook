summary: "Argues that AI risks driving banks toward visual and experiential sameness—'AIrSpace'—and challenges leaders to preserve differentiation through vision, brand, and execution."
description: "Builds on the 'AirSpace' idea of cultural homogenization to show how AI could accelerate convergence across banking apps, products, and customer interactions. Warns that using the same data and models will produce similar outputs, and recommends differentiation through strategic choices, distinctive brand, and bold execution rather than reliance on commoditized tools."
