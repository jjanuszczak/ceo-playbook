## Acquired: Meta

This episode offers a comprehensive history of Facebook’s evolution into Meta. It traces Mark Zuckerberg’s journey from the Harvard dorm room to leading one of the world’s most valuable companies. The hosts break down the brilliance behind the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, the company's aggressive pivot to AI and the Metaverse, and the unique "founder mode" leadership style that allows Zuckerberg to bet the company on the next big technology shift.

I am not a Facebook user, but I am a Meta user (WhatsApp). Apparently, I am one of four billion monthly active users of Meta products, almost half of the entire world's population\! It also made for a great movie. Hard to believe that the movie about Facebook is already 15 years old:

{{< youtubeLite id="lB95KLmpLR4" label="The Social Network Official Trailer" >}}

The product and technical side of me just really liked the story of how they maintained performance while they scaled in the early days of Facebook’s massive growth:

* **School-by-School Rollout** wasn't just a technical necessity; it was a massive product and engagement advantage. By launching one school at a time (e.g., Harvard, then Stanford, then Yale), they ensured that even with a small total number of users, the local density was 100%. If you were a student at that school, everyone you knew was on it. The site immediately felt "alive" and addictive because the content was relevant to your actual real-world social life. This also created FOMO and demand at schools yet to be covered. On the technical side it solved for *identity*. Because every user was verified as a real student at your specific school, there was an implicit barrier to entry that kept out anonymous trolls and strangers.  
* **One Server Per School (Sharding)**: In the very early days, Facebook’s architecture was effectively "sharded" by university. This meant that each school effectively had its own server (or set of servers) and database. This architecture allowed them to scale linearly; to launch a new school, they simply added a new server for that specific university. This physical separation meant that if traffic spiked at Harvard, it wouldn't crash the site for students at Stanford.  
* **The "LAMP" Stack**: They utilized the standard LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), which was simple, cheap, and allowed for rapid iteration. They prioritized shipping features quickly over code perfection, famously pushing code that was "good enough" to keep the site running.  
* **Performance via Isolation**: By isolating user bases (you could initially only see profiles within your own school), they avoided the complex engineering challenges of a massive, globally interconnected graph. This bought them time to build the more complex, unified architecture later as they opened up to high schools and eventually the general public.

## Acquired: The Google Series

A massive, multi-part saga covering the complete history of Google.

* **The Origin of Search:** Chronicles the early days of Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford, the development of the PageRank algorithm, and the business model innovation that turned search into a money-printing machine.  
* **Alphabet:** Covers the explosion of products beyond search: Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and YouTube, and the restructuring into Alphabet to manage this sprawling empire.  
* **The AI Company:** Focuses on Google's deep roots in artificial intelligence (including the acquisition of DeepMind and the invention of the Transformer), its "innovator's dilemma" in the face of OpenAI, and its current all-out push to win the generative AI war.

I remember when Google search came out (I think I was using AltaVista before that). I was an early [Writely](https://www.failory.com/google/writely) user, a web app that was acquired by Google and ultimately morphed into today’s Google Docs. I have been a user with Google as it navigated (survived?) multiple paradigm shifts (browser, mobile, social) and now AI. It was fitting to better understand Google’s clear advantage in AI, and how they were both early *and late* to it resulting in Google management’s "code red" in December 2022 following the release and popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT: considered a threat to Google's search engine business and its advertising model.

## How I Built This: Magnolia

Guy Raz interviews the power couple (Chip & Joanna Gaines) behind the Fixer Upper phenomenon. The episode details how they transformed a small remodeling business in Waco, Texas, into a media and retail empire. They discuss the challenges of sudden fame, the decision to walk away from their hit TV show at its peak to focus on their family and business health, and how they built the Magnolia brand on authenticity and faith.

I never thought about it this way, but home renovation and construction was a big part of my formative years. When I was young, my family built a sizable addition to our house, and my father did much of the work himself to save money\! I learned so much about the whole process: from framing and insulation to plumbing, electrical, drywall, and tiling. To this day, I still watch countless shows about home and furniture renovation and restoration (the people building off-grid hold a special fascination for me). It was great to listen to this podcast and learn how this subject became such a popular phenomenon.

## Acquired: Stratechery

Ben Thompson, the author of the influential tech newsletter [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/), joins the show to discuss his own business journey. They explore the "Aggregation Theory" framework he popularized, the history of the subscription media model he pioneered, and his analysis of the tech industry's shifting landscape. It is a meta-conversation about the business of analyzing business.

As a long-time reader of Stratechery, I’ve always appreciated its deep focus on tech strategy and highly recommend it as a resource. But what was truly fascinating was learning about the *business* of Stratechery: how Ben built his own newsletter tech before viable off-the-shelf solutions existed, the evolution of his platform, and how he successfully monetized it. As a publisher myself, seeing how he took this to the next level is incredibly inspiring and provides super interesting insights.

And speaking of the "business" behind these creators, the Acquired team (whose episodes are heavily featured in this top 10 list for 2025) just dropped their Holiday special: **10 Years of Acquired**. It’s an equally compelling look at the fascinating business *of* Acquired, as well as the phenomenal content we all love to consume:

## Invest Like the Best: Bill Gurley
_The Gift and The Curse of Staying Private_

Legendary venture capitalist Bill Gurley (Benchmark) returns to discuss the state of the venture capital markets. He argues that the trend of companies staying private for too long has created "zombie unicorns" and reduced accountability. He also touches on the impact of AI, the regulatory environment, and why liquidity is essential for a healthy startup ecosystem.

Being involved in venture capital investing across Southeast Asia, the issues discussed here hit particularly close to home. In markets with less developed capital, the possibility of exiting through an IPO feels even more distant. That's why we focus so heavily on Distributed to Paid-in (DPI), sometimes even more than Total Value to Paid-in (TVPI), given the real challenges in securing an exit. This episode sparked a thought in my mind about the potential of tokenization to create secondary markets for companies that would otherwise remain strictly private. I’m genuinely excited to see where this goes.

## Acquired: Lockheed Martin

This episode tells the incredible story of the Skunk Works division and its legendary leader, Kelly Johnson. It covers the development of aviation icons like the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird (the fastest plane ever built). The hosts also discuss the massive 1995 merger with Martin Marietta and the unique dynamics of the defense industry, blending engineering marvels with complex government strategy.

Listening to this episode was a perfect follow-up to having read Ben Rich’s [*Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years of Lockheed*](https://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed/dp/0316743003) earlier this year. As a designer and operator of corporate innovation programs, I find this story is even more relevant today than it was when Lockheed started the Skunk Works division in 1943\. The author’s own words resonate: 

>“Any company whose fortune depends on developing new technologies should have a Skunk Works in operation.” 

More so than ever before, the future of most companies depends on developing or masterfully using new technologies.

## In Good Company: Nasdaq CEO
_Tech Innovation, Leadership and Fighting Financial Crime_

Nicolai Tangen interviews Adena Friedman, the President and CEO of Nasdaq. She explains how Nasdaq transformed from a traditional exchange into a global technology company providing software to capital markets. The conversation highlights her leadership style, the role of cloud technology in modern finance, and Nasdaq's efforts to use AI to detect and fight financial crime in real-time.

Here is something I did not realize until I met Tal Cohen, Nasdaq President in Manila earlier this year: Nasdaq isn’t just an exchange. It’s really a technology platform company.

* Financial technology powers 35% of its business.  
* Capital access platforms lead with 41%.  
* **Only 23%** is traditional market services.

{{< figure

    >}}

This isn’t evolution. **This is transformation**. It was great to hear more about how Nasdaq discovered that while they had technology assets, they were not a scaled player in that space. So they scaled up their tech and made some strategic technology acquisitions. Today most of their revenue comes from outside of being a market operator.

## The Rest is History: The Last Viking

Episodes: The Last Viking (Parts 1-3)

A thrilling historical series on the life of Harald Hardrada, the "Last Viking." The episodes follow his exile from Norway, his time as a mercenary commander in the elite Varangian Guard protecting the Emperor in Constantinople, and his accumulation of vast wealth. The saga culminates in his return to the North to claim the Norwegian throne and his fateful invasion of England in 1066, ending at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.

It cannot all be technology, venture capital and innovation! In high school, I remember voting in English class **not** to do another Shakespeare play. What we got instead was [_The Canterbury Tales_](https://chaucer.fas.harvard.edu/pages/text-and-translations). In hindsight, this middle English classic was **much tougher** than the relatively more modern Shakespeare. But it took us back a lot closer to the Norman invasion and that major pivot in English history. I have been fascinated ever since, and this was simply a very entertaining story on the lead up to that pivotal event.

## How I Built This: PayPal

Max Levchin shares the gritty origin story of PayPal. He discusses his childhood in the Soviet Union, his move to the US, and the intense early days of Confinity (PayPal's predecessor). The episode covers the fierce competition-turned-merger with Elon Musk's X.com, the battle against fraudulent transactions which led to the invention of the Captcha, and the company's eventual sale to eBay that birthed the famous "PayPal Mafia."

The PayPal Mafia, comprising founders and early employees of PayPal such as Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Max Levchin, Reid Hoffman, David Sacks, and others, has had a significant impact on the venture capital landscape through the firms they've established or led. This includes VC firms directly founded by Mafia members (e.g. Founders Fund, SciFi, etc.) and larger firms where Mafia members are partners but not sole founders (e.g., Sequoia Capital or Greylock Partners). Great to listen to how it all started.

## How I Built This: AriZona Beverage Company

Don Vultaggio recounts how he built AriZona Iced Tea into a powerhouse by taking on giants like Snapple and Lipton with a distinct strategy: big 23oz cans and a fixed 99-cent price point. He discusses the importance of package design, his fight to keep the company private and family-owned, and the decade-long legal battle with a co-founder that nearly cost him the business.

Jeff Bezos once said (on the a16z podcast\!) “There are two kinds of companies, those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less.” One model maximizes margins, squeezing as much as it can from each customer. The other minimizes margins, driving scale by charging as little as possible. Don chose the second path, trying to keep the 24oz can under a dollar no matter what.

## Bonus: The Jamie Dimon Interview
_Live from Radio City Music Hall with Acquired\!_

Recorded live in New York City, this rare long-form interview with the JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman covers his storied career. Dimon discusses his early days, being fired from Citigroup, turning around Bank One, and the "fortress balance sheet" philosophy that helped JPMorgan survive and thrive during the 2008 financial crisis. It is a masterclass in leadership, risk management, and patriotism in business.

What a come back story\! Great to hear it first hand and with the guys from Acquired.

## Double Bonus: Do NOT Pass GO!

Was Lizzie J. Magie, the true inventor of Monopoly? Was she robbed of credit & profit? How many other women's groundbreaking ideas have been lost to history due to Innovation Bias?

Cautionary Tales podcast dives deep into this story & the implications for today's innovators in this episode.

I did not know about the history behind the board game Monopoly. Tim Harford did a great job sharing it. It Feels like this story could be made into a movie.

The facts back up what this story exposes: women are named as inventors on only a small fraction of patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). All-women and women led teams receive a small percentage of total venture capital funding.

I read that women represent approximately 16% of first-time venture capital-backed entrepreneurs. This percentage declines with subsequent ventures, with only 9% of women securing funding for a second venture and a mere 4% starting three or more venture capital-backed businesses. Even though backing repeat founders is a proven strategy: data from Harvard Business School suggests that entrepreneurs with a track record have an almost double success rate in their next venture, compared to the rate for first-time founders.

## Carve Outs

Ironically, Writely was [covered](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/episode-9-writely-google-docs) in Season 1 of Acquired, which fits nicely into the recent Acquired Holiday Special: **10 Years of Acquired** where Michael Lewis speaks directly to how different the show  was in the first season, focusing on _successful_ acquisitions. It is therefore especially fitting to review it!

{{< spotify type="episode" id="3v6XYuofiZLmITBnlTNgxp" >}}

Secondly, Benchmark (Bill Gurley's firm) was also [featured](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/benchmark-capital) in 11th season of Acquired. Not a bad way to get you in the mood for the episode in the list above!
