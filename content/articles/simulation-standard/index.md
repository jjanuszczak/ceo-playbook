summary: "A foundational proposal arguing that while BPMN standardized process 'flows', the industry lacked a standard for the 'physics' of simulation—resources, costs, and time. "
description: "Presented at the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference, this paper identifies a critical disconnect in the BPM lifecycle: the lack of a standardized format for defining simulation scenarios. Januszczak and Hook argue that without interoperability between BPM suites and simulation engines, organizations face high data acquisition costs and 'analysis paralysis'. The paper proposes a meta-model for a 'Simulation Scenario Standard'—encompassing resource models, event injections, and activity parameters—which served as a precursor to modern specifications like BPSim"
