summary: "Explains why designing to interfaces and loosely coupling systems, teams, and processes lets organisations move faster, reduce risk, and test product‑market fit independently."
description: "Argues that the principle of coding to an interface extends beyond software: by decoupling sales from development and content from platform, teams can pre‑sell, iterate, and compose offerings without monolithic constraints. Provides practical examples and an actionable rule of thumb: look for false dependencies and introduce API‑like boundaries to unlock scalability, resilience, and faster learning."
