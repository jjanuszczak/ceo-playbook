title: Signals
description: What caught my attention—and why
---

Signals is a weekly or biweekly curation of things I bookmarked, saved, or paused on.

Not because they’re trending, but because they reveal something about how technology,
capital, leadership, and systems are evolving.

Each signal includes a short note on *why it matters* and *how I’m interpreting it*.
Think of this as raw input before synthesis.
