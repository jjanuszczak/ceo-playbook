**Astrophysicist turned Fintech CEO**
_Applying the rigor of astrophysics to the chaos of fintech innovation. Bridging technology, capital, and leadership for the next generation of transformative ventures_

I’m a financial services executive and technology advisor with over 25 years of experience leading transformation across banking, insurance, and commercial software. Most recently, I served as President & CEO of UBX, the fintech and corporate venture capital arm of [UnionBank of the Philippines](https://www.unionbankph.com/), where we built the country’s leading embedded finance platform from the ground up. Over six years, I scaled the business from concept to industry leadership, launched multiple ventures through a venture studio model, secured strategic investment from [SBI Holdings of Japan](https://www.sbigroup.co.jp/english/), and introduced the Philippines’ first central bank recognized stablecoin and blockchain-based settlement network. My career has always centered on the intersection of technology, capital, and leadership: turning ideas into scalable, measurable value.

Today, I work with financial institutions, venture studios, startups and investors across Southeast Asia and North America to help them transform, innovate, and build institutional-grade digital capabilities. My focus is on making innovation investable: designing the systems, governance, and operating models that allow organizations to grow sustainably and confidently. Whether advising CEOs, shaping strategy, or structuring deals, I bring a balance of vision and execution that aligns teams, accelerates outcomes, and builds long-term resilience.

Having worked across Canada, the United States, and Asia, I bring a global perspective to how financial systems evolve and how emerging markets leapfrog technology. I’m committed to strengthening innovation ecosystems, developing leaders, and advancing responsible transformation that expands access, opportunity, and economic participation.

## How I Stay Sharp

In addition to longer [essays and strategy pieces]({{< relref "articles" >}}), I keep a running practice I call [Signals]({{< relref "signals" >}}).

[Signals]({{< relref "signals" >}}) is a weekly or biweekly curation of things I bookmarked or paused on. Not because they were trending, but because they revealed something about how technology, capital, leadership, or systems are evolving.

Each signal includes a short note on why it matters and how I’m interpreting it. It’s raw input before synthesis, and often the starting point for deeper essays.
