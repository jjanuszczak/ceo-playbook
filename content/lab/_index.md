_Bridging the gap between executive strategy and the engine room._

I have spent my career operating at the intersection of strategy, finance, and technology. In the boardroom, we discuss digital transformation and competitive moats. But true innovation doesn't happen on a slide deck; it happens when you understand the constraints and capabilities of the tools at your disposal.

This section of my site is my personal R&D sandbox. It is distinct from my Articles & Insights, which focus on leadership and market strategy. Here in The Lab, I share my hands-on learnings and experiments, technical deep dives, and prototypes.

**Why do this?** Because the best way to cut through the hype cycle is to build something yourself. I explore these technologies not to become an engineer, but to become a better leader of engineers. By testing the limits of the technology myself, I gain the intuition necessary to make better strategic bets.

**What you will find here**: Expect long-form overviews, technical walkthroughs, glimpses of code, unpolished hypotheses, and post-mortems on failed experiments. 

If you are a business leader, scan these to understand the practical application of emerging tech. If you are a builder, dig in and let me know what I could have done better.
