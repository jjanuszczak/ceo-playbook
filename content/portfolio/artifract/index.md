summary: "The Philippines' first tokenized NFT platform backed by UBX and Unit 256 Ventures, which utilizes 'Token Factory' technology to fractionalize real-world assets like fine art and collectibles."
description: "Artifract creates a new asset class for investors by bridging the physical and digital worlds. Powered by a proprietary 'NFT-as-a-Service' engine, it allows institutions, estates, and collectors to digitize high-value assets—starting with masterpieces by National Artists like Juvenal Sansó and Abdulmari Imao. Discover how this platform democratizes access to blue-chip art, allowing fractional ownership for as little as P50,000, while ensuring copyright protection and provenance on the blockchain."
