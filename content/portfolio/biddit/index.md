summary: "UBX-backed PropTech platform that transforms real estate investing by allowing users to bid for, purchase, and co-own vetted properties with accessible entry points."
description: "Biddit challenges the traditional barriers to entry in the real estate market: high capital requirements and complex due diligence. By leveraging the asset inventory of UnionBank and its partners, Biddit offers a secure marketplace for property auctions and pioneers a 'fractional ownership' model. This allows investors to own bite-sized shares of income-generating assets, effectively turning illiquid real estate into an accessible, digital-first asset class for the mass market."
