summary: "A white-label 'Transact-Now-Pay-Later' platform that empowers merchants to offer branded installment plans."
description: "Splix is an open finance vertical developed by UBX that democratizes access to credit. Unlike consumer-facing BNPL apps, Splix functions as an embeddable, white-label solution that allows enterprises—such as insurance providers and HMOs—to offer flexible installment payment options directly within their own platforms. It bridges the gap between service providers and financial inclusion by enabling payments with or without credit cards."
