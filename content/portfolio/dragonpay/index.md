summary: "The Philippines' leading alternative payment gateway that pioneered the aggregation of over 50,000 physical and digital payment channels, bridging the gap between the unbanked population and e-commerce."
description: "Dragonpay solved the Philippines' 'cash-on-delivery' dilemma long before digital wallets became mainstream. Founded in 2010, it remains the backbone of the country's e-commerce infrastructure, enabling merchants to accept payments via online banking, over-the-counter (7-Eleven, Cebuana Lhuillier), and e-wallets through a single API. Discover how this profitable, BSP-regulated pioneer attracted strategic investment from regional unicorn Xendit to further scale its 'cash-to-cloud' capabilities."
