summary: "The UBX-backed lending marketplace that has processed tens of billions in credit applications, closing the financing gap for over 65,000 MSMEs through same-day digital approvals."
description: "SeekCap creates a new asset class for investors by digitizing the broken MSME lending process. Unlike traditional banks with 30-day approval cycles, SeekCap utilizes alternative credit scoring and a marketplace of partners (including UnionBank, ping An's OneConnect, and rural banks) to disburse funds in as little as 24 hours. Explore how this venture has become the country's most active lending platform, integrating directly into ecosystems like Lazada and Foodpanda to capture high-quality borrowers at the source."
