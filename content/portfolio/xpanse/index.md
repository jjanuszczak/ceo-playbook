summary: "API-first platform that standardizes and aggregates financial services, allowing developers, banks, and fintechs to launch banking, identity, and payment products with a single integration."
description: "Xpanse is the digital superhighway connecting the Philippines' fragmented financial sector. As the country's first Open Finance platform, it aggregates APIs from banks, insurers, and payment networks into a unified layer. This allows any business—from a rural bank to a tech startup—to 'embed' financial features like eKYC (powered by Alibaba Cloud's Zoloz), fund transfers, and account aggregation without building the infrastructure from scratch. Discover how Xpanse is accelerating the shift toward a consent-driven data economy."
