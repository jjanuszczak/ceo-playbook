Developed by Shiptek Solutions and backed by a strategic 30% stake from UBX, it is the first platform in the Philippines to integrate blockchain for immutable data provenance. This 'truth layer' allows XLOG to offer something competitors cannot: instant, collateral-free supply chain financing (XLOGPay) to unbanked truckers and forwarders based on their verified transaction history. Discover how this venture is scaling regionally to Malaysia and bridging the critical gap between moving goods and moving money."
