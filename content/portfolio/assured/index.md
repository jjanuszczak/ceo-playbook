summary: "Insurtech platform that aggregates protection products from top carriers like Chubb, PGA Sompo, and Etiqa, allowing any digital channel to embed insurance coverage via a single API."
description: "Assured tackles the Philippines' historically low insurance penetration rate (<2%) by shifting the distribution model from 'sold' to 'embedded.' Instead of relying on traditional agents, Assured allows non-insurance platforms—such as bills payment centers (i2i), logistics fleets, and e-commerce shops—to bundle protection products directly into their customer's transaction flow. Discover how this venture leverages partnerships with global giants like Chubb and Coherent to offer 'sachet-sized' Personal Accident, Health, and Cyber insurance to the mass market."
