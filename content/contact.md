Drawing on two decades of leadership in financial services, I help organizations navigate regulatory complexity, digital transformation, and growth strategy.

I’m always interested in connecting with fellow innovators in the fintech and banking sectors. Reach out regarding speaking engagements, media commentary, or potential advisory partnerships. If you have a complex challenge you are trying to solve, I’d love to hear about it.
