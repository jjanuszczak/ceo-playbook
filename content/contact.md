Drawing on two decades of leadership in financial services, I help organizations navigate regulatory complexity, digital transformation, and growth strategy.

Good work starts with a real conversation. Tell me what you're working on and we'll figure out if I can help. I’m always interested in connecting with fellow innovators in the fintech, banking, and now energy sectors. 

Reach out regarding speaking engagements, media commentary, or other potential advisory partnerships. If you have a complex challenge you are trying to solve, I’d love to hear about it.
