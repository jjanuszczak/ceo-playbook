Not low returns. Not “early returns.” Zero.\nMIT’s State of AI in Business 2025 report makes it clear that this failure is not about models, regulation, or budgets. It is about approach, and more importantly, a profound misunderstanding among business leaders of what AI actually is and how it transforms organizations.\nAfter reading the report and reflecting on my own experience building digital businesses, leading shared service transformations, and running a fintech that processed billions in annual transaction volume, the diagnosis is clear:\nGenAI is not failing. Leaders are failing to understand the paradigm shift.\nBelow are my key insights and takeaways.\nProductivity ≠ P\u0026amp;L Impact. This Is Where Most Strategies Die # MIT notes that tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are achieving widespread adoption, but primarily as individual productivity tools, not drivers of enterprise value. Enterprises confuse activity with impact. Just because your workforce is generating better emails doesn’t mean your company is transforming.\nThe report highlights a critical disconnect: ChatGPT improves individual output. But has almost no influence on corporate workflows, cost structures, or revenue lines. This aligns with what I see in real-world transformations: organizations are excited to “use AI” but rarely redesign the core processes where real value is created.\nAI doesn’t create P\u0026amp;L impact unless it replaces something expensive. Usually external. The MIT report reinforces this. For one best in class organization covered in the study:\nBPO elimination = $2M–$10M annual savings Agency replacement = 30% reduction Vendor consolidation = millions saved That’s real money. And it explains why countries like the Philippines, home to massive BPO sectors, should be paying attention. The structural implications are significant.\nThe Real Divide Isn’t Technical. It’s Organizational # The report’s central argument is brilliantly summarized: The dividing line is not intelligence; it’s memory, adaptability, and learning capability. AI that doesn’t learn might be more akin to autocomplete with better grammar. This matters because enterprises still operate under a pre-AI architecture. They’re built around static tools, rigid processes, and departments that don’t talk to each other.\nBut GenAI isn’t a tool. It’s a learning system. And learning systems only deliver value when:\nThey integrate into workflows They remember context They adapt faster than humans can patch them Most enterprise AI fails precisely because:\nIt has no memory It can’t evolve It breaks in edge cases It doesn’t match how the business actually works Executives evaluate AI like they evaluate SaaS. But AI is not SaaS. It’s a fundamentally different class of technology.\nShadow AI: The Most Important Signal Boards Are Ignoring # One of the most fascinating insights from the report: 90% of employees use AI for work. Only 40% of companies have purchased an AI subscription.. This is the “shadow AI economy.” Employees have already crossed the divide. Enterprises have not.\nThis should keep executives awake at night, not because of risk, but because of what it signals: Your workforce knows what \u0026ldquo;good AI\u0026rdquo; looks like. And they will quietly reject anything worse.\nI’ve seen this firsthand in digital transformations:\nIf the official tool is slow → people circumvent it If the tool is rigid → spreadsheets reappear If the workflow doesn’t match reality → shadow systems emerge Shadow AI is the new “spreadsheet problem,” but at 100x the speed and complexity.\nMore importantly: shadow AI reveals the real use cases. The ones your employees already value. Smart leaders will learn from this rather than resist it.\nThe Successful Startup Playbook Lives On # MIT’s findings match what I’ve observed mentoring founders and investing in startups, regardless of whether it involves AI or not: winners go narrow and deep. Losers go broad and shallow.\nAccording to the report, startups that cross the divide:\nStart with a single painful workflow Achieve visible value in days or weeks Learn from feedback immediately Embed deeply into existing systems Expand outward only after winning a foothold And importantly: Trust and distribution matter more than the underlying model. MIT notes that successful startups close deals by:\nLeveraging system integrators Partnering with BPOs Using board and executive referrals Riding existing enterprise procurement channels This is classic enterprise sales. GenAI hasn’t changed it. What has changed is that the strongest moats are being built around:\nWorkflow integration Domain-specific memory Organizational learning Not around models.\nThe Enterprise Model Is Already Shifting: From Software to Services # In a way, enterprises have really always purchased services (albeit packaged as software). The report offers a subtle insight that many will miss:\n“Successful buyers treat AI vendors more like BPO providers than SaaS companies.”\nThis is huge as it makes what was often implied explicit: enterprises don’t want tools. They want outcomes. And they want vendors accountable for those outcomes.\nThis shift mirrors what I saw at UBX as we moved toward embedded finance and managed services:\nClients no longer wanted the plumbing They wanted the result: instant payments, automated lending, reconciled settlements And they wanted commercial models aligned to outcomes, not licenses GenAI is following the same trajectory. Enterprises will cross the divide when they stop buying software and start buying capability. This aligns perfectly with the concept of AI being packaged as agents. Some solutions even give their AI agents names!\nThe Next Architectural Shift: The Agentic Web # MIT closes with a view of the near future that aligns strongly with what I see happening: the rise of the Agentic Web. Systems of interoperable, learning, memory-rich agents coordinating across the enterprise. This is not science fiction. The infrastructure is already here in the form of evolving agent frameworks.\nThis evolution is exactly what may allow enterprises to:\nReplace BPOs Automate back-office operations Achieve zero-touch processes Generate exponential learning loops When people talk about “AI replacing jobs,” they often misunderstand. The more relevant shift is that AI may replace entire categories of outsourced workflows before it replaces internal roles.\nThe implications for countries like the Philippines are profound.\nWhat Leaders Should Do Now # Based on MIT’s data and my own experience, here are the strategic imperatives:\nStop Piloting. Start Integrating. Pilots are where AI goes to die. Integration is where value lives. Buy, Don’t Build, unless the process is uniquely mission-critical. MIT’s data: external builds succeed twice as often as internal ones. Focus on back-office automation. This is where the hidden ROI lives, and where BPO-heavy organizations can gain the most. Empower line managers, not central AI labs. Your power users already know where AI creates value. Choose tools that learn. Anything static is obsolete before deployment. AI Isn’t a Technology Problem. It’s a Leadership Problem # MIT’s research echoes what I’ve seen across three decades of digital transformation in banking, insurance, government, and fintech: AI rewards organizations that are willing to redesign themselves. It punishes those that try to bolt innovation onto old structures.\nThe GenAI Divide is not a gap in capability. It’s a gap in imagination.\nThe winners won’t be the companies that try AI. They’ll be the ones that let AI change how they work.\nAnd that window, as MIT warns, is closing fast.\n","date":"27 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/mit-ai-report-2025/","section":"Articles","summary":"MIT’s 2025 State of AI in Business report reveals a stark truth: 95% of enterprises get zero ROI from GenAI.

After revisiting his article How to Prepare for Strategy, and comparing it with my own experience leading transformation and growth in financial services and fintech, I believe Martin’s critique deserves far more attention, especially among leadership teams who wonder why their strategy “process” rarely produces strategic clarity.\nBelow is my take on the core ideas and what they mean for executives, boards, and strategy advisors alike.\n1. Strategy Begins With the Gap Between Intent and Outcome # Martin makes a deceptively simple point: The only productive starting point for strategy is the mismatch between what leadership intended and what actually happened.\nNot market trends. Not competitor analysis. Not long lists of initiatives.\nStrategy begins with truth.\nTo put it plainly: What did we want? What did we choose? What happened? And why did those choices fail or succeed?\nAs a CEO, this resonates deeply. The most honest conversations I’ve had with boards or leadership teams always began with this gap because that gap exposes the causal logic behind past decisions. If you cannot explain why your previous choices produced the results they did, you have no foundation for choosing differently.\nThis is the real work. Everything else is noise.\n2. Strategy Is a Leadership Function—Not a Committee Exercise # Martin is unequivocal: Strategy cannot be delegated.\nNot to Corporate Planning. Not to consultants. Not to the mid-management “strategy working group.”\nOnly the executive leadership team (ELT) can own strategy, because only they own the choices that allocate capital, talent, risk, and reputation.\nThis mirrors how I think about values inside a company. You cannot outsource the creation of values, because values are meaningless unless lived by leaders. Strategy is the same. If strategy is produced by staff, consultants, or analysts, you will get a plan, not a set of choices. And a plan—no matter how well formatted—does not guarantee commitment or coherence.\nThere is nothing more dangerous than a company whose staff-defined “strategy” contradicts the intent of the leaders who are accountable to shareholders.\n3. The Hidden Danger of Pre-Work # In most corporations, pre-work is seen as a way to “prepare” for strategy. Martin argues the opposite: pre-work—especially done without the ELT—creates bias and false certainty.\nIt is a way for someone else to set the agenda. It “loads the dice” with preferred data. It nudges leaders toward predetermined conclusions.\nAnd in many cases, this pre-work becomes so elaborate that it replaces strategic thinking entirely.\nI have seen this repeatedly: an internal strategy team or a consultant comes in with a heavy deck full of facts no one asked for, crafted to steer leadership toward a conclusion that was decided long before the offsite.\nIn this sense, pre-work is not preparation. It is contamination.\nThe only legitimate pre-work is answering the questions inside the heads of the ELT and the board—not what someone else thinks they should be thinking about.\n4. Facts Matter. Decks Don’t # Martin emphasizes that strategy teams should not be producing decks. Their job is to curate a concise fact base—and only the facts directly relevant to the choices leaders must grapple with.\nThis is not analysis for analysis’s sake. This is data with utility.\nIn my own advisory work, I always ask: Will this fact change a choice? If the answer is no, it’s noise.\nThe value of analysis lies not in volume, but in clarity.\n5. Strategy Is a Thinking Process, Not a Planning Process # Strategy is not a document. Strategy is a discipline of reasoning.\nRoger Martin emphasizes that strategy must be a live, iterative exploration of possibilities and trade-offs, not a mechanical planning cycle. This aligns closely with the approach popularized by IDEO, whose human-centered design methodology treats strategy as an iterative process of reframing problems, generating hypotheses, and testing them in the real world. Their perspective on strategic planning (summarized in IDEO U’s article “Strategic Planning: How to Get Started”) reinforces that leaders must be in the room, actively shaping choices, not passively reviewing decks assembled by others.\nBoth Martin and IDEO converge on the same truth: Great strategy emerges from engaged, creative, participatory thinking—not from documents produced in advance of that thinking.\nWhen leaders engage directly with ambiguity, pressure-test assumptions, and co-create choices, strategy becomes real. When they review a “strategy deck” created elsewhere, it becomes performative. This difference—participation versus observation—is often the difference between strategic clarity and strategic theatre.\nImplications for Strategy Advisors (and Internal Strategy Teams) # For advisors—whether internal or external—this redefines the job:\n1. Advisor as Thinking Partner, Not Author of Strategy # Your value is not writing a plan. Your value is provoking sharper thinking, structuring choices, and challenging assumptions.\n2. Protect the Integrity of the Process # Ensure all analysis is in service of the questions leaders themselves care about. Kill all pre-work that implicitly sets direction without shared ownership.\n3. Anchor on the Choices That Matter # Where to play. How to win. What capabilities and management systems must be built. These choices—and only these—define strategy.\n4. Clarify Ownership Every Step of the Way # Strategy belongs to the ELT. The board challenges and endorses. Advisors facilitate. No one else decides.\nThis is a quick win any advisor can bring to the table: eliminate agenda-driven pre-work and put ownership back where it belongs.\nWhy This Matters Now # Companies today face infinite information, rapid change, and constant noise. Teams crave anchors: something stable and durable that guides decisions even as circumstances change.\nRoger Martin’s framing makes strategy more like values: Timeless until the leadership chooses to change it.\nStrategy cannot be allowed to drift with each planning cycle or each incoming deck. It must remain a coherent set of choices that guide the company until new choices explicitly replace them.\nConclusion: Start With the Truth, End With Shared Choices # If I summarize Martin’s argument in one sentence, it is this:\nStrategy starts with the truth about past choices, lives in the heads of accountable leaders, and succeeds only when those leaders make new choices that close the gap between aspiration and outcome.\nI’ve seen the cost of doing it the wrong way: months of preparation, enormous decks, and a strategy no one believes in.\nAnd I’ve seen the impact of doing it the right way: small rooms, honest conversations, and choices that actually change behaviour, investment, and outcomes.\nThe difference is not process. The difference is ownership.\nLeadership owns strategy—or you don’t have one.\n","date":"23 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/strategy-prework/","section":"Articles","summary":"Most corporate “strategy” work starts with months of pre-work and thick decks, and never reaches the real question: why did our past choices produce the results they did?

Common filesystems (ext3, NTFS, etc.) choked badly once a directory crossed ~10,000–20,000 entries. A busy Linux kernel repository could easily generate hundreds of thousands of objects over time. SSDs basically didn’t exist for consumers, and even if you had fast hardware, many developers were on laptops or shared servers with mediocre disks. Throwing \u0026ldquo;faster hardware\u0026rdquo; at it wouldn’t have helped most users, and it certainly wouldn’t have made Git usable on large projects back then. Instead, Linus chose a tiny, zero-cost software fix: split into 256 subdirectories using the first two hex digits of the hash. It costs almost nothing in code complexity, adds no runtime overhead, and completely sidesteps the filesystem pathology.\nIt’s a textbook example of thoughtful systems design:\nSolves the real bottleneck (filesystem behavior) rather than a symptom. Scales from tiny repos to monstrous ones with no configuration changes. Still beneficial today even on NVMe SSDs and modern filesystems (fewer directory entries = fewer inodes, less metadata pressure, faster clones on network filesystems, etc.). You see the same philosophy elsewhere in Git: content-addressed storage, Merkle-tree history, packfiles, delta compression… almost everything is built to be stingy with I/O and robust on slow or unreliable hardware, because that was the reality when it was born. Faster CPUs and SSDs are nice bonuses, but Git didn’t need to wait for them to be blazingly fast.\nUnder the Covers # Git stores objects (blobs, trees, commits, and tags) in the .git/objects directory using a loose object format by default. Each object is identified by its SHA-1 hash (a 40-character hexadecimal string, e.g., a1b2c3d4... for SHA-1; Git now uses SHA-256 in some cases, but the structure is similar).\nWhen storing a loose object:\nThe first two characters of the hash become a subdirectory name (e.g., a1). The remaining characters become the filename inside that subdirectory (e.g., b2c3d4...). So an object with hash a1b2c3d4e5f6... ends up at .git/objects/a1/b2c3d4e5f6....\nWhy This Specific Structure? # This is a deliberate performance optimization for filesystem efficiency:\nAvoids huge flat directories\nMany filesystems (especially ext3/ext4 in older configurations, ReiserFS, NTFS, and others common in the mid-2000s when Git was created) slow down dramatically or even have hard limits when a single directory contains tens or hundreds of thousands of files.\nDirectory listing (readdir), lookups, and metadata operations become O(n) or worse. Real-world examples: the Linux kernel repo can have millions of objects over time; putting them all directly under .git/objects/ would make operations painfully slow. \u0026ldquo;Fan-out\u0026rdquo; with exactly 256 subdirectories\nUsing the first two hex characters creates 256 possible subdirectories (00 to ff).\nThis spreads objects roughly evenly (assuming uniform hash distribution). Even in a repository with millions of objects, each subdirectory typically holds only a few thousand files — a number most filesystems handle efficiently. The top-level .git/objects/ directory itself stays tiny (just 256 entries + pack/ and info/). One level is enough; deeper would be overkill\nTwo characters (1 byte) → 256 buckets → sufficient for virtually all repositories. Using three characters (4096 subdirectories) would add unnecessary depth and overhead for typical repos. Linus Torvalds and early Git developers chose this as a pragmatic sweet spot based on real filesystem behavior at the time. Bonus: Fast partial-hash lookups\nWhen you type a short unique hash (e.g., git show a1b2c3), Git only has to look in one specific subdirectory (.git/objects/a1/) and do a simple filename prefix match — very fast, even without an index.\nWhat Happens Later? # New objects start as loose (one file per object). Over time, git gc packs them into efficient packfiles (.git/objects/pack/) for storage and transfer, where this directory structure is no longer used. The fan-out is mainly for the loose phase.\nThis design has proven extremely effective and is why Git repositories remain fast even when they contain hundreds of thousands or millions of objects.\n","date":"22 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/git-design/","section":"Articles","summary":"Explains why Git stores loose objects in 256 subdirectories keyed by the first two hash characters and how that simple layout optimizes filesystem performance and scalability.","title":"Designing Around Constraints","type":"articles"},{"content":"","date":"22 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/technology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/banking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Banking","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/digital/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Digital","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/external/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"External","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fintech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fintech","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/payments/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Payments","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/stablecoins/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Stablecoins","type":"tags"},{"content":"How x402 is changing the payments landscape\nWhy are online payments still stuck in 1999?

They have already emerged.\u0026rdquo;\nI tried to give a thought-provoking keynote at the Asia Bank Tech Forum 2023 and challenged the audience to rethink their definition of innovation. I argued that the technologies we obsess over today are merely tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s legacy systems. To understand where banking is going, we first have to understand the history of how humans get work done.\nHere are the key takeaways from the talk on the true path to the next generation of banking.\nThe Evolution of Productivity # Human history can be broken down into three distinct phases of work, moving from linear to exponential growth:\nThe Manual Age (Linear): For thousands of years—from early agriculture to the Medici banks of the 1400s—productivity was tied strictly to population. If you wanted more output, you needed more people. The formula was simple: Humans took data, applied rules, and got an answer. The Industrial Revolution (Assisted): Machines began assisting humans. While the paradigm remained the same (applying rules to data), the efficiency of machines allowed production to finally outpace population growth. The Information Age (Automated): Computers changed the game by allowing us to feed rules into a machine before doing the task. This allowed for consistent, repeatable automation—the birth of modern digital banking. This history of mechanization explains why production has exploded over the last 60 years. However, we are now entering a fourth, radically different phase.\nThe AI Paradigm Shift: Flipping the Script # The most profound insight from this talk is a fundamental shift in how we process information. For the first time in history, we aren\u0026rsquo;t just automating rules; we are discovering them.\nThe Old Way: We feed Data + Rules into the machine → We get Answers. The AI Way: We feed Data + Answers into the machine → We get Rules. This is a massive shift. We currently generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily, yet we utilize less than 1% of it because we are limited by the rules we currently know. Machine learning allows us to uncover rules for things we couldn\u0026rsquo;t previously define—like language, thought, and image recognition.\nBanking is Necessary, Banks Are Not # As technology evolves, the \u0026ldquo;bank\u0026rdquo; as a physical location or distinct entity is disappearing. Bill Gates’ famous 1994 prediction: \u0026ldquo;Banking is necessary, but banks are not\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are seeing this reality today. Airlines like ANA are becoming banks, and open banking platforms are empowering thousands of small businesses to provide banking utility to their local communities. The future of finance is not just digital; it is open, embedded, and decentralized.\nWhat Does the Future Look Like? # If AI is writing the rules, where does that leave us? The honest answer is: We don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nBecause the new paradigm generates rules from data rather than human logic, the future of banking will likely look like nothing we have seen before. However, the potential is limitless. The goal isn\u0026rsquo;t just better technology; it is total inclusion.\nThe ultimate question isn\u0026rsquo;t about the tech itself, but the outcome: \u0026ldquo;What will it look like when all 115 million Filipinos are connected without any barrier to the global economy?\u0026rdquo;.\nWant to dive deeper into the shift from linear banking to exponential fintech?

Yet for all its significance, it remains one of the most digitally underserved and financially inaccessible sectors in the Philippines.\nIn this 2021 talk, I explored how property technology (\u0026ldquo;PropTech\u0026rdquo;) can reshape the country’s real estate landscape by embedding financial services and unlocking inclusive participation. The opportunity is enormous: real estate is the second-largest asset class in the world, and in the Philippines it continues to experience strong demand and growth. But it is also illiquid, costly, and accessible to only a very small segment of the population.\nWhy Tokenization Matters # Our hypothesis is simple: the future belongs to invisible, embedded financial services, financial capabilities built seamlessly into the experiences that matter most. Real estate is exactly such an experience. That belief led us to develop a platform for tokenizing real estate assets, breaking a property into digital, fractionalized tokens that investors can buy, trade, and hold just like any other financial asset.\nTokenization promises three major benefits: # 1. Liquidity Real estate in the Philippines is still largely illiquid, with limited participation even in REITs. Digitally tradable tokens can unlock a secondary market and bring flexibility to a traditionally rigid asset class.\n2. Lower Costs High transaction costs—taxes, fees, commissions—add substantial friction. Tokenization creates room for more transparent and streamlined processes.\n3. Democratization Today, real estate investing is binary: you buy the whole thing, or you don’t. Fractional ownership lets ordinary Filipinos participate in the country’s fastest-growing asset class, often for the first time.\nWhat We Built # The venture described in the video (temporarily paused due to the pandemic) consisted of three layers:\nA digital marketplace with wallet, KYC, and investment onboarding A tokenization engine that fractionalizes vetted properties and automates yields, income distribution, and rights through smart contracts A secondary trading market powered through our strategic partnership and investment in a BSP-regulated digital asset exchange (e.g. PDAX) To support this ecosystem, we also integrated lending, insurance, and seamless cash-in/cash-out services—embedding financial services directly within the real estate experience.\nThe Barriers That Remain # Tokenization is still in its infancy globally. While the technology is proven, the real challenges lie in:\nTesting the market’s actual appetite for tokenized real estate Structuring appropriate intermediate vehicles (contracts, long-term leaseholds, SPVs) that can legally be tokenized Evolving regulatory frameworks to support crowdfunding, digital asset exchanges, and potentially even blockchain-based titles in the future The Philippines has the opportunity to leapfrog if regulators, property developers, fintechs, and investors move thoughtfully and collaboratively.\nA Path Toward Inclusive Prosperity # Ultimately, PropTech is not simply about technology, it is about economic participation. If we can solve the structural, legal, and regulatory challenges, we can open the doors of real estate investing to millions more Filipinos.\nThat is the promise of PropTech and the reason we continue to explore this space: to move the country toward a future where real estate is not just a privilege for the few, but an accessible investment opportunity for the many.\n","date":"9 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/videos/proptech/","section":"Videos","summary":"Real estate is one of the Philippines’ fastest-growing asset classes—but it remains illiquid, costly, and out of reach for most people.
