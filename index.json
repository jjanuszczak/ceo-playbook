And today, with the rise of AI tools, Python has become the playground for everyone—from traditional developers to newcomers leveraging AI to help them code.\nAs I’ve been using Python more seriously, I’ve had to figure out a whole world of tools to manage my code. Like many, I’m exploring and learning as I go. And along the way, I discovered why Python’s flexibility is both a blessing and a bit of a puzzle to solve. That puzzle usually shows up the moment a project breaks after a pip install, or when code that worked yesterday suddenly doesn’t today.\nWhy Does Dependency Hell Happen in Python? # So why does this whole dependency-management challenge pop up so often in Python?\nAt its core, Python has a philosophy of being easy to learn and easy to share. That philosophy is a big part of what makes the ecosystem so vibrant and dynamic. There are packages for almost anything you want to do, and that’s fantastic. But it also means that different projects can quickly end up needing different versions of the same package. When it’s that easy to pull in dependencies, version conflicts become almost inevitable.\nDifferent projects often need different versions of the same library. Without isolation, everything collides Other languages can face similar issues, but Python’s ecosystem and design choices make this more visible:\nBreadth and popularity: Python is used for everything from web apps to data science to scripting. That breadth means massive reuse of third-party packages—and frequent version clashes. Contrast with lower-level languages: Languages like C or C++ have historically taken a more monolithic or manual approach. Dependencies are often handled via build systems and compilation rather than a central package index. (That’s changing with tools like Conan and vcpkg, but the culture is different.) In short, Python’s dependency challenges are not a flaw so much as a side effect of its success.\nA Similar Story in Node.js and npm # It’s not just Python.\nIf you’ve ever worked with Node.js and npm, you’ll recognize the same pattern. Node’s ecosystem shares a similar philosophy: make it incredibly easy to reuse and distribute code. That speed and flexibility unlocked massive innovation—but also created dependency sprawl.\nJust as Python evolved virtual environments and lock files, Node evolved node_modules, package.json, and eventually lockfiles for the same reason: fast reuse comes with coordination costs. Modern ecosystems trade simplicity at the start for tooling complexity later.\nThe Evolution of Python Tools: From Virtualenv to UV # As I was teaching myself how to handle all this, I discovered that Python’s tooling didn’t appear all at once—it evolved in layers, each solving a specific pain point.\nIt started with virtual environments to isolate dependencies. Then tools like pyenv helped manage Python versions themselves. Poetry came along to simplify dependency management and packaging. And most recently, Astral’s UV has pushed things even further with a focus on performance and developer experience.\nEach tool didn’t replace the previous one outright—it responded to what still hurt.\nVirtual Environments # In the early days, Python developers quickly found themselves in the aforementioned dependency hell. Different projects needed different versions of the same libraries, and installing everything globally was a recipe for breakage.\nVirtual environments were the first real hero. They allowed each project to live in its own sandbox, with its own dependencies, without interfering with the rest of your system.\nIf you want a practical walkthrough, this detailed tutorial on virtual environments does a great job of explaining the mechanics.\nPyenv and Version Management # Virtual environments solved package conflicts—but not Python version conflicts. Older macOS versions (pre-12.3) came with Python 2.7 pre-installed, intended for Apple\u0026rsquo;s internal system tools. In modern macOS versions (12.3 and later) Apple has removed Python from the default operating system installation.\nHowever, if you have installed the Xcode Command Line Tools, you will have a version of Python 3 (e.g., Python 3.9.6) installed as a dependency for the developer tools. This version is intended for system use, not for general development, and it is recommended to install a separate, up-to-date Python version for your projects. Confusing?\nThat’s where pyenv comes in. Need Python 3.7 for one project and 3.11 for another? pyenv makes installing and switching between them straightforward, without touching your system Python.\nThis Real Python guide offers a clear, hands-on explanation of how it works and why it matters.\nPoetry: The Story Behind the Tool # Poetry was created by Sébastien Eustace, who saw that Python developers were still stitching together too many tools: pip, requirements.txt, setup.py, and virtual environments—often by hand.\nPoetry’s key insight was to treat the project as the first-class object, not just the environment. By unifying dependency management, packaging, and environment handling around a single pyproject.toml file, Poetry dramatically reduced friction and inconsistency.\nIt wasn’t just a new tool—it was a cleaner mental model. Poetry filled the gaps that older tools left open and became a favorite for modern Python projects.\nUV: The Next Evolution # Now, let’s talk about Astral’s UV.\nUV is the brainchild of Astral’s founder Charlie Marsh, driven by a simple question: what if Python tooling were both simpler and dramatically faster? The answer was to rebuild core pieces of the workflow in Rust.\nBy writing UV in Rust, the team focused on speed, low overhead, and predictable behavior. In practice, this shows up as dramatically faster installs and dependency resolution—especially noticeable in larger projects and CI pipelines.\nUV takes the lessons learned from virtualenv, pyenv, and Poetry, and pushes them further. It’s less about adding features and more about removing friction. Datacamp has a great UV tutorial which also covers the difference between UV, Poetry, PIP, Conda, and virtualenv.\nEach new tool didn’t replace the previous one, it solved the next layer of pain Conclusion # Hopefully, this gives you a big-picture understanding of why Python (and ecosystems like Node.js) struggle with dependency complexity—and how the community has steadily evolved better tools to cope with it.\nI didn’t know any of this upfront. I learned it by breaking things, fixing them, and gradually understanding why these tools exist in the first place.\nThe journey from virtualenv to UV is really the story of Python’s community continuously refining the developer experience. Each tool isn’t just a replacement, but an evolution—driven by developers who felt the pain and believed there had to be a better way.\nIf you want to go further, here are a few entry points into Python’s broader role in AI and vibe coding:\nStanford CS146S: the first comprehensive university course covering how coding LLMs are transforming every stage of the software development life cycle. \u0026ldquo;The assignments are intended to take you from noob to expert in how to use AI to improve your software engineering productivity.\u0026rdquo; Introductions to LangChain and agentic AI libraries Top Python-based resource for deep learning For me, learning these tools wasn’t about mastering Python. It was about understanding how modern software ecosystems evolve when speed, collaboration, and experimentation are the priority. If you’ve ever wondered why Python feels both magical and messy, you’re not alone.\nCarve Outs # ","date":"1 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/lab/pyenv/","section":"Labs","summary":"A practitioner’s walkthrough of why Python suffers from dependency hell, how tools like virtualenv, pyenv, Poetry, and UV emerged to solve it, and what this evolution tells us about modern software ecosystems.","title":"The Evolution of Python Environment Management","type":"lab"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vibe-coding/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vibe Coding","type":"tags"},{"content":"Guidance for leaders navigating digital transformation.

These episodes from 2025 featured deep dives into tech giants, historical epics, and masterclasses in business building. These episodes explain how the world\u0026rsquo;s best companies are reinventing themselves.\nNote that these top podcast episodes were discovered by the author in 2025, even though two or three may have been released prior to 2025. Meta: The \u0026ldquo;Founder Mode\u0026rdquo; Pivot at Scale # This episode offers a comprehensive history of Facebook’s evolution into Meta. It traces Mark Zuckerberg’s journey from the Harvard dorm room to leading one of the world’s most valuable companies. The hosts break down the brilliance behind the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, the company\u0026rsquo;s aggressive pivot to AI and the Metaverse, and the unique \u0026ldquo;founder mode\u0026rdquo; leadership style that allows Zuckerberg to bet the company on the next big technology shift.\nI am not a Facebook user, but I am a Meta user (WhatsApp). Apparently, I am one of four billion monthly active users of Meta products, almost half of the entire world\u0026rsquo;s population! It also made for a great movie. Hard to believe that the movie about Facebook is already 15 years old:\nThe Innovation Lesson: Constraint as a Growth Engine # My fascination with their early engineering isn\u0026rsquo;t just nostalgia; it\u0026rsquo;s a lesson in strategic friction. By strictly limiting access (one school at a time), Facebook didn\u0026rsquo;t just solve a technical scaling problem; they solved the \u0026ldquo;cold start\u0026rdquo; problem that kills most networks. In the age of AI, where everyone is rushing to be \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; to everyone immediately, Meta’s history proves that density beats breadth. A small, highly engaged network is infinitely more valuable than a massive, shallow one:\nSchool-by-School Rollout wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a technical necessity; it was a massive product and engagement advantage. By launching one school at a time (e.g., Harvard, then Stanford, then Yale), they ensured that even with a small total number of users, the local density was 100%. If you were a student at that school, everyone you knew was on it. The site immediately felt \u0026ldquo;alive\u0026rdquo; and addictive because the content was relevant to your actual real-world social life. This also created FOMO and demand at schools yet to be covered. On the technical side it solved for identity. Because every user was verified as a real student at your specific school, there was an implicit barrier to entry that kept out anonymous trolls and strangers. One Server Per School (Sharding): In the very early days, Facebook’s architecture was effectively \u0026ldquo;sharded\u0026rdquo; by university. This meant that each school effectively had its own server (or set of servers) and database. This architecture allowed them to scale linearly; to launch a new school, they simply added a new server for that specific university. This physical separation meant that if traffic spiked at Harvard, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t crash the site for students at Stanford. The \u0026ldquo;LAMP\u0026rdquo; Stack: They utilized the standard LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), which was simple, cheap, and allowed for rapid iteration. They prioritized shipping features quickly over code perfection, famously pushing code that was \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; to keep the site running. Performance via Isolation: By isolating user bases (you could initially only see profiles within your own school), they avoided the complex engineering challenges of a massive, globally interconnected graph. This bought them time to build the more complex, unified architecture later as they opened up to high schools and eventually the general public. Listen to the episode:\nGoogle: Managing the Innovator\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma in Real-Time # A massive, multi-part saga covering the complete history of Google.\nThe Origin of Search: Chronicles the early days of Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford, the development of the PageRank algorithm, and the business model innovation that turned search into a money-printing machine. Alphabet: Covers the explosion of products beyond search: Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and YouTube, and the restructuring into Alphabet to manage this sprawling empire. The AI Company: Focuses on Google\u0026rsquo;s deep roots in artificial intelligence (including the acquisition of DeepMind and the invention of the Transformer), its \u0026ldquo;innovator\u0026rsquo;s dilemma\u0026rdquo; in the face of OpenAI, and its current all-out push to win the generative AI war. The Strategy Lesson: The Incumbent’s Trap # Having used Google tools from Writely to Gemini, the pattern is clear: Google is rarely the first to invent (search existed before them; cloud docs existed before them), but they are usually the best at scaling it. However, the AI shift is different. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just a technology shift; it’s a business model conflict. Their 2022 \u0026ldquo;Code Red\u0026rdquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t about technology, afterall, Google invented the Transformer. It was about the Innovator\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma. The lesson for 2026: You cannot defensive-moat your way to victory when the underlying unit of economics (ads vs. answers) is changing.\nThe episodes:\nMagnolia: The Power of Authenticity Over Scale # Guy Raz interviews the power couple (Chip \u0026amp; Joanna Gaines) behind the Fixer Upper phenomenon. The episode details how they transformed a small remodeling business in Waco, Texas, into a media and retail empire. They discuss the challenges of sudden fame, the decision to walk away from their hit TV show at its peak to focus on their family and business health, and how they built the Magnolia brand on authenticity and faith.\nThe Brand Lesson: Vertical Integration of Attention # I never thought about it this way, but home renovation and construction was a big part of my formative years. When I was young, my family built a sizable addition to our house, and my father did much of the work himself to save money! I learned so much about the whole process: from framing and insulation to plumbing, electrical, drywall, and tiling.\nMy appreciation for the \u0026ldquo;craft\u0026rdquo; of building mirrors what the Gaineses did with their business. Most media personalities rent their audience to networks. Chip and Joanna vertically integrated their attention economy, moving from being talent on a TV network to owning the network, the retail experience, and the product lines. In a creator economy, the ultimate strategic move isn\u0026rsquo;t getting famous; it\u0026rsquo;s converting fame into a proprietary distribution channel that you control.\nListen to the episode:\nStratechery: Aggregation Theory \u0026amp; The Business of Insight # Ben Thompson, the author of the influential tech newsletter Stratechery, joins the show to discuss his own business journey. They explore the \u0026ldquo;Aggregation Theory\u0026rdquo; framework he popularized, the history of the subscription media model he pioneered, and his analysis of the tech industry\u0026rsquo;s shifting landscape. It is a meta-conversation about the business of analyzing business.\nThe Media Lesson: The Unbundling of Expertise # As a long-time reader of Stratechery, I’ve always appreciated its deep focus on tech strategy and highly recommend it as a resource. But what was truly fascinating was learning about the business of Stratechery: how Ben built his own newsletter tech before viable off-the-shelf solutions existed, the evolution of his platform, and how he successfully monetized it.\nAs a publisher, Ben Thompson’s story resonates because it validates the \u0026ldquo;N of 1\u0026rdquo; company. Stratechery proves that in the digital age, you don\u0026rsquo;t need a newsroom to build a media empire; you need a unique viewpoint and a direct billing relationship. The strategic takeaway here is about Sovereign Writing: owning the tech stack means owning the customer relationship, which protects you from the algorithm changes that decimated traditional media.\nListen to the episode:\nAnd speaking of the \u0026ldquo;business\u0026rdquo; behind these creators, the Acquired team (whose episodes are heavily featured in this top 10 list for 2025) just dropped their Holiday special: 10 Years of Acquired. It’s an equally compelling look at the fascinating business of Acquired, as well as the phenomenal content we all love to consume:\nBill Gurley: Why \u0026ldquo;Staying Private\u0026rdquo; Is Killing Innovation # The Gift and The Curse of Staying Private\nLegendary venture capitalist Bill Gurley (Benchmark) returns to discuss the state of the venture capital markets. He argues that the trend of companies staying private for too long has created \u0026ldquo;zombie unicorns\u0026rdquo; and reduced accountability. He also touches on the impact of AI, the regulatory environment, and why liquidity is essential for a healthy startup ecosystem.\nThe Venture Lesson: Liquidity is the Truth Serum # Living and investing in Southeast Asia, Gurley’s warning about \u0026ldquo;Zombie Unicorns\u0026rdquo; is the reality we face daily. In markets with less developed capital, the possibility of exiting through an IPO feels even more distant. That\u0026rsquo;s why we focus so heavily on Distributed to Paid-in (DPI), sometimes even more than Total Value to Paid-in (TVPI), given the real challenges in securing an exit. This episode sparked a thought in my mind about the potential of tokenization to create secondary markets for companies that would otherwise remain strictly private. Until then, we are artificially inflating valuations without proving real value. Liquidity is the only honest metric.\nListen to the episode:\nLockheed Martin: How to Operationalize Radical Innovation # This episode tells the incredible story of the Skunk Works division and its legendary leader, Kelly Johnson. It covers the development of aviation icons like the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird (the fastest plane ever built). The hosts also discuss the massive 1995 merger with Martin Marietta and the unique dynamics of the defense industry, blending engineering marvels with complex government strategy.\nThe Innovation Lesson: Structural Separation # Listening to this episode was a perfect follow-up to having read Ben Rich’s Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years of Lockheed earlier this year. As a designer and operator of corporate innovation programs, I find this story is even more relevant today than it was when Lockheed started the Skunk Works division in 1943. The author’s own words resonate:\n“Any company whose fortune depends on developing new technologies should have a Skunk Works in operation.”\nThis is the core of my philosophy on corporate innovation. You cannot ask the same team optimizing for quarterly efficiency to also invent the future—the incentives are too aligned against risk. Lockheed proves that radical innovation requires structural separation: a physical and bureaucratic air-gap between the \u0026ldquo;exploit\u0026rdquo; (core business) and \u0026ldquo;explore\u0026rdquo; (Skunk Works) teams.\nListen to the episode:\nNasdaq: A Masterclass in Tech Transformation # Tech Innovation, Leadership and Fighting Financial Crime\nNicolai Tangen interviews Adena Friedman, the President and CEO of Nasdaq. She explains how Nasdaq transformed from a traditional exchange into a global technology company providing software to capital markets. The conversation highlights her leadership style, the role of cloud technology in modern finance, and Nasdaq\u0026rsquo;s efforts to use AI to detect and fight financial crime in real-time.\nThe Pivot Lesson: From Operator to Platform # My meeting with Nasdaq President Tal Cohen in Manila earlier this year clarified a massive strategic shift: Nasdaq stopped trying to just be the market and started selling the market infrastructure. This is the ultimate SaaS pivot. If you are an operator in a complex, regulated industry (like finance or healthcare), the biggest growth opportunity might not be serving more customers, but software-izing your internal tools and selling them to your competitors. Don\u0026rsquo;t just dig for gold; sell the shovels.\nNasdaq today:\nFinancial technology powers 35% of its business. Capital access platforms lead with 41%. Only 23% is traditional market services. Nasdaq is a technology \u0026amp; platform company This isn’t evolution. This is transformation. It was great to hear more about how Nasdaq discovered that while they had technology assets, they were not a scaled player in that space. So they scaled up their tech and made some strategic technology acquisitions. Today most of their revenue comes from outside of being a market operator.\nListen to the episode:\nThe Last Viking: Strategic Risk \u0026amp; The Mercenary Mindset # The Rest is History: The Last Viking (Parts 1-3)\nA thrilling historical series on the life of Harald Hardrada, the \u0026ldquo;Last Viking.\u0026rdquo; The episodes follow his exile from Norway, his time as a mercenary commander in the elite Varangian Guard protecting the Emperor in Constantinople, and his accumulation of vast wealth. The saga culminates in his return to the North to claim the Norwegian throne and his fateful invasion of England in 1066, ending at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.\nIt cannot all be technology, venture capital and innovation! In high school, I remember voting in English class not to do another Shakespeare play. What we got instead was The Canterbury Tales. In hindsight, this middle English classic was much tougher than the relatively more modern Shakespeare. But it took us back a lot closer to the Norman invasion and that major pivot in English history. I have been fascinated ever since, and this was simply a very entertaining story on the lead up to that pivotal event.\nThe Leadership Lesson: Resource Staging for the Big Bet # While this is history, it reads like a startup post-mortem. Harald Hardrada didn\u0026rsquo;t just invade England on a whim; he spent decades as a mercenary in Constantinople explicitly to accumulate the \u0026ldquo;Series C\u0026rdquo; capital required to launch his bid for the throne. It’s a lesson in strategic patience: sometimes you have to go abroad and grind in a high-risk environment (the Varangian Guard) to build the war chest needed for your ultimate vision.\nThe episodes:\nPayPal: Surviving the Fraud Wars \u0026amp; Building the \u0026ldquo;Mafia\u0026rdquo; # Max Levchin shares the gritty origin story of PayPal. He discusses his childhood in the Soviet Union, his move to the US, and the intense early days of Confinity (PayPal\u0026rsquo;s predecessor). The episode covers the fierce competition-turned-merger with Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s X.com, the battle against fraudulent transactions which led to the invention of the Captcha, and the company\u0026rsquo;s eventual sale to eBay that birthed the famous \u0026ldquo;PayPal Mafia.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Talent Lesson: Friction Forges Excellence # The PayPal Mafia, comprising founders and early employees of PayPal such as Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Max Levchin, Reid Hoffman, David Sacks, and others, has had a significant impact on the venture capital landscape through the firms they\u0026rsquo;ve established or led. This includes VC firms directly founded by Mafia members (e.g. Founders Fund, SciFi, etc.) and larger firms where Mafia members are partners but not sole founders (e.g., Sequoia Capital or Greylock Partners).\nThe \u0026ldquo;PayPal Mafia\u0026rdquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t happen by accident. It happened because the problems they faced (global fraud, regulatory existential threats) were so hard that they repelled average talent and attracted only the obsessive problem solvers. The lesson for founders: don\u0026rsquo;t hide the difficulty of your mission. The hardness of the problem is your best recruiting filter for high-agency talent.\nListen to the episode:\nAriZona: Pricing Constraints as a Competitive Advantage # Don Vultaggio recounts how he built AriZona Iced Tea into a powerhouse by taking on giants like Snapple and Lipton with a distinct strategy: big 23oz cans and a fixed 99-cent price point. He discusses the importance of package design, his fight to keep the company private and family-owned, and the decade-long legal battle with a co-founder that nearly cost him the business.\nThe Strategy Lesson: Price as a Forcing Function # Jeff Bezos once said (on the a16z podcast!) “There are two kinds of companies, those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less.” One model maximizes margins, squeezing as much as it can from each customer. The other minimizes margins, driving scale by charging as little as possible. Don chose the second path, trying to keep the 24oz can under a dollar no matter what. By committing to the 99-cent price point for 30 years, AriZona forced itself to be operationally superior to Snapple and Coke. They couldn\u0026rsquo;t rely on marketing; they had to rely on supply chain efficiency. The \u0026ldquo;So What?\u0026rdquo;: Sometimes, imposing a rigid constraint on your business model is the best way to force innovation in your operating model.\nNot quite under a dollar! 102 Philippine Pesos = $1.74 USD Listen to the episode:\nBonus: Jamie Dimon on Leadership Through the \u0026ldquo;Fortress Balance Sheet\u0026rdquo; # Live from Radio City Music Hall with Acquired!\nRecorded live in New York City, this rare long-form interview with the JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman covers his storied career. Dimon discusses his early days, being fired from Citigroup, turning around Bank One, and the \u0026ldquo;fortress balance sheet\u0026rdquo; philosophy that helped JPMorgan survive and thrive during the 2008 financial crisis. It is a masterclass in leadership, risk management, and patriotism in business.\nThe Finance Lesson: Resilience is an Offensive Weapon # The \u0026ldquo;Fortress Balance Sheet\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t just about safety; it\u0026rsquo;s about optionality. JPMorgan won 2008 (and subsequent crises) because while everyone else was playing defense, their balance sheet allowed them to play offense (buying Bear Stearns, etc.). In a volatile 2025 economy, cash reserves aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;lazy capital\u0026rdquo;, they are strategic call options on distressed assets.\nListen to the interview:\nDouble Bonus: Do NOT Pass GO! # Was Lizzie J. Magie, the true inventor of Monopoly? Was she robbed of credit \u0026amp; profit? How many other women\u0026rsquo;s groundbreaking ideas have been lost to history due to Innovation Bias?\nCautionary Tales podcast dives deep into this story \u0026amp; the implications for today\u0026rsquo;s innovators in this episode.\nI did not know about the history behind the board game Monopoly. Tim Harford did a great job sharing it. It Feels like this story could be made into a movie.\nThe facts back up what this story exposes: women are named as inventors on only a small fraction of patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). All-women and women led teams receive a small percentage of total venture capital funding.\nI read that women represent approximately 16% of first-time venture capital-backed entrepreneurs. This percentage declines with subsequent ventures, with only 9% of women securing funding for a second venture and a mere 4% starting three or more venture capital-backed businesses. Even though backing repeat founders is a proven strategy: data from Harvard Business School suggests that entrepreneurs with a track record have an almost double success rate in their next venture, compared to the rate for first-time founders.\nListen to the episode:\nThe Question for 2026: Optimization or Reinvention? # Consumption is easy; application is hard. As we look toward the new year, these stories present two distinct, yet equally successful, archetypes for growth.\nOn one side, you have the Efficient Operator (AriZona), proving that rigid constraints and operational excellence can build a moat that lasts decades. On the other, you have the Aggressive Reinventor (Meta), proving that survival sometimes requires betting the entire company on a future that hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet.\nAs you finalize your own roadmap, I leave you with this question: Which model is your business mirroring in 2026? Are you locking in your \u0026ldquo;$0.99 price point\u0026rdquo; to out-execute the market, or are you entering \u0026ldquo;Founder Mode\u0026rdquo; to force a radical pivot?\nLet me know your thoughts on LinkedIn or X (or reach out via this site). I’d love to hear how you’re applying these lessons.\nPlaylists # If you are on Spotify you can grab the entire playlist here:\nI have done this in previous years too!

Fantastic talk. Watch it:\nIronically, Writely was covered in Season 1 of Acquired, which fits nicely into the recent Acquired Holiday Special: 10 Years of Acquired where Michael Lewis speaks directly to how different the show was in the first season, focusing on successful acquisitions.

If Modernism was about progress (force of will) and Post-Modernism was about innovation (managing risk), Prediction is about order (contributing information).\nIt is a brilliant piece of cultural analysis. But if we look at this through the lens of system architecture there is a fundamental physics problem that Danco touches on but doesn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly name.\nThe shift isn\u0026rsquo;t just cultural. It is dimensional.\nWe are finally moving from an economy obsessed with Space to an economy obsessed with Time.\nThe Spatial Trap of Post-Modernism # For the last forty years, Venture Capital and Innovation Strategy have been solving a spatial geometry problem.\nWe built portfolios. We mapped \u0026ldquo;market landscapes.\u0026rdquo; We looked for \u0026ldquo;white space.\u0026rdquo; The entire Post-Modern VC model (the \u0026ldquo;Power Law\u0026rdquo; playbook) is essentially a game of coverage. If you cover enough surface area (invest in 100 startups), one of them will hit. It’s a brute-force approach to spatial probability. Afterall, what is an investment thesis other than a spatial map of the market?\nDanco calls this \u0026ldquo;Post-Modernism,\u0026rdquo; where truth is relative and success is about \u0026ldquo;rendering\u0026rdquo; the right product for the right niche. In this system, \u0026ldquo;Product-Market Fit\u0026rdquo; is a static coordinate. You find the fit, you lock it in, you scale.\nBut this model ignores the most critical variable in the equation.\nRelativity Finally Coming of Age # In the midst of the Modern era, in 1905, Einstein published Special Relativity, proving that Time is not a constant background track; it is a dimension as malleable and critical as Space. He fused them into Spacetime.\nYet, business strategy has remained stubbornly \u0026ldquo;Newtonian\u0026rdquo;. We treat Time as a linear constant: a timeline on a Gantt chart rather than a dynamic variable that changes the value of everything else.\nIt has taken a century for this scientific reality to permeate the zeitgeist. We are only now realizing that the \u0026ldquo;Space\u0026rdquo; (the Idea, the Market, the Product) is irrelevant if the \u0026ldquo;Time\u0026rdquo; coordinate is wrong.\nThe 42% Variable (The Bill Gross Insight) # If we want to operationalize this, we have to look at the data. In what I consider a canonical piece of innovation research, Idealab founder Bill Gross analyzed 200 companies to isolate the single biggest factor for success.\nHe looked at five variables:\nIdea Team Business Model Funding Timing The Silicon Valley orthodoxy (the Post-Modern view) would bet the house on the \u0026ldquo;Team\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Idea.\u0026rdquo;\nThe result? Timing accounted for 42% of the difference between success and failure. Watch the talk:\nAirbnb launched during the 2008 financial crisis, right when people needed to monetize their spare rooms. YouTube launched exactly when broadband penetration hit critical mass and Flash solved the video codec problem.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;Product-Market Fit.\u0026rdquo; It’s Product-Moment Fit (thanks for this phrase Alex Danco!).\nIn the Post-Modern era, we tried to solve this by ignoring it. We sprayed capital across the spatial landscape hoping to get lucky on the temporal one.\nPrediction Markets: The Financialization of Time # This is where Danco’s thesis becomes a roadmap for system design.\nHe suggests that Prediction Markets are the successor to the \u0026ldquo;Innovation\u0026rdquo; model. Why? Because a prediction market is the first financial instrument that explicitly prices Time.\nWhen you buy a contract on Kalshi or Polymarket, you aren\u0026rsquo;t just betting on what will happen (Space/Idea); you are betting on when it will resolve. The contract collapses the infinite subjective possibilities of Post-Modernism into a single, objective, time-bound truth.\nIn the old model, a startup was an \u0026ldquo;assertion of power\u0026rdquo; (Modernism) or a \u0026ldquo;calculated risk\u0026rdquo; (Post-Modernism). In the new model, a venture is a contribution of information to a temporal ledger.\nDesigning for the Fourth Dimension # What does this mean for how we build?\nIt means we need to stop designing static organizations and start designing temporal systems.\nFrom Portfolios to Streams: Instead of holding a static portfolio of assets, modern venture builders need to manage a stream of decisions. The value is in the delta (rate of change), not the static position. From \u0026ldquo;Is this a good idea?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Is this the right time?\u0026rdquo;: We need to rigorously assess the why now. Is the underlying infrastructure ready? Is the consumer psychology ready? Monetizing the Z-Axis: If Prediction is the new atomic unit of value, then the businesses of the next decade won\u0026rsquo;t just sell products; they will sell certainty. They will sell the ability to navigate the time dimension. Einstein gave us the math in 1905. Bill Gross gave us the data in 2015. Alex Danco has given us the cultural theory in 2025.\nThe architecture of the next generation of value isn\u0026rsquo;t about finding space. It\u0026rsquo;s about mastering time.\n","date":"26 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/prediction-market/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"An overlay on Alex Danco\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Prediction\u0026rsquo; thesis, arguing that business strategy is finally moving from a spatial \u0026lsquo;portfolio\u0026rsquo; model to a temporal \u0026lsquo;stream\u0026rsquo; model.","title":"The Temporal Architecture of Alpha","type":"articles"},{"content":"","date":"26 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/venture-building/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Venture Building","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/venture-capital/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Venture Capital","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/erp/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ERP","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sme/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SME","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/transformation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Transformation","type":"tags"},{"content":"In the trenches of building UBX, we operated with a clear mission: democratize financial access for the Philippine SME. We had the strategy, we had the capital (thanks to our investors), and we had the distribution channels. But even seasoned generals lose battles on the way to winning the war.\nOne of our boldest experiments was ERPX. The vision was textbook fintech strategy: build an \u0026ldquo;Operating System\u0026rdquo; for small businesses, give it away for free (or close to it), and monetize the financial rails: payments, lending, and insurance embedded directly into the workflow.\nWe did what any pragmatic execution team would do in 2019: we didn\u0026rsquo;t reinvent the wheel. We forked a robust open-source ERP project to provide the scaffolding. We stripped it down, localized it, and pushed it out to the market.\nAnd it stalled.\nFor years, I analyzed this through the lens of product-market fit. We hypothesized that we gave them a cockpit when they needed a bicycle. We tried to force-feed full-stack accounting when their bleeding-neck problem was just Point-of-Sale (POS) or Inventory Management. As a side benefit, this approach would also compliment our online store builder Sentro.\nBut after watching the rise of Digits and hearing Jeff Seibert’s philosophy, I realized our mistake wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about features. It was about Data Architecture.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Legacy Debt\u0026rdquo; We Didn\u0026rsquo;t Know We Had # At UBX, we built ERPX on a traditional SQL database structure. The same \u0026ldquo;forms and fields\u0026rdquo; architecture that has defined accounting since the 1990s. We were asking Filipino business owners, who run their empires on notebooks and intuition, to become data entry clerks.\nJeff Seibert at Digits pinpoints this perfectly: Legacy software requires you to manually structure data before you can use it. You have to define the vendor, pick the category, and reconcile the bank feed before the software gives you any value.\nWe tried to solve the Cost barrier (by making it free). But we failed to solve the Effort barrier.\nThe Two Things We Got Right (That Digits Still Misses) # Ironically, our 2019 hypothesis about what the Philippine SME needs was spot on. We believed the \u0026ldquo;wedge\u0026rdquo; into the business wasn\u0026rsquo;t the General Ledger (GL). It was the operational front-line: POS and Inventory.\nTo this day, Digits is purely a layer on top of the financial stack (QuickBooks/Xero). They don\u0026rsquo;t do POS. They don\u0026rsquo;t do Inventory. They are solving the \u0026ldquo;Review\u0026rdquo; phase of accounting, not the operational \u0026ldquo;Entry\u0026rdquo; phase.\nIn the Philippines, digitization for SMEs happens at the counter, not in the back office. Our instinct to build POS/Inventory first was correct. Where we failed was connecting that front-line data to the back-office ledger without requiring a human to be the middleware.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Living Model\u0026rdquo; vs. The Static Ledger # If I could go back to the UBX war room in 2019 with today’s insights, here is how we would have pivoted ERPX:\nStop Building \u0026ldquo;Forms\u0026rdquo;: We spent months designing input screens. We should have spent that time building ingestion engines. The goal is zero data entry. The Shift from \u0026ldquo;Entry\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Review\u0026rdquo;: Digits uses AI to categorize transactions based on the entire history of the firm, not just rigid rules. In 2019, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have GPT-4, but we had machine learning. We could have built a \u0026ldquo;Review First\u0026rdquo; interface where the software guessed the category (e.g., \u0026ldquo;This looks like a supplier payment to San Miguel Corp, correct?\u0026rdquo;) rather than forcing the user to type it in. The Ledger as a Graph, Not a List: We treated the ledger as a static record of truth. It should have been a \u0026ldquo;Living Model\u0026rdquo;, a dynamic vector that understands that this specific SME treats \u0026ldquo;Grab\u0026rdquo; as a delivery expense, while that SME treats it as a travel expense. Given our investments in blockchain technology, we really should have known this. The Next Battlefield # To the fintech founders looking at the Philippines today: The opportunity to build the \u0026ldquo;ERPX\u0026rdquo; of the future is still wide open.\nThe winner won\u0026rsquo;t just be the one who offers the cheapest software or the best lending rates (though embedded finance is still the endgame). The winner will be the one who realizes that for an SME owner, every minute spent on data entry is a minute lost on sales.\nThe next great Filipino ERP won\u0026rsquo;t look like QuickBooks. It won\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;Chart of Accounts\u0026rdquo; setup wizard. It will connect to the POS, watch the bank feed, and simply ask: \u0026ldquo;I see you sold 50 units today and paid your supplier. Do you want me to update your inventory and cash flow forecast?\u0026rdquo;\nThat is the difference between a tool and a teammate. That is how we win.\nEndnotes # Jeff Seibert on Digits # Great video where Jeff shares the story of Digits:\nERPX Launch # July 2019 and we are about to luanch ERPX!\nBig launch at the UBX office!

We\u0026rsquo;re talking about something that\u0026rsquo;s often shoved into a dusty HR handbook: company values. But trust me, in today\u0026rsquo;s cut-throat, rapid-growth, tech-driven world, values are not a soft skill or an afterthought. They are a mission-critical instrument for alignment and, frankly, operational efficiency.\nSome big questions to tackle: Where do these values actually come from? Is it some kumbaya, bottom-up discovery session, or a rigorous, top-down mandate? And here\u0026rsquo;s the real gut check: How do you know you’ve nailed the right ones?\nA hint for you: the best values are actually reversible, and potentially costly to defend. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sweating a little when you write them down, you\u0026rsquo;re doing it wrong! Now, let\u0026rsquo;s talk durability. Values should be durable, but absolutely not immortal. They need to survive annual budget cycles, sure, but the moment your strategy defines a major pivot or an existential transformation, those values need to be reviewed and likely go straight to the chopping block. You need to audit them to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re not the anchor dragging you down.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent time integrating frameworks from management gurus with real-world examples. Think the legendary, low-cost culture of Southwest Airlines, or the customer obsession machine that is Amazon. And what I\u0026rsquo;ve found is a roadmap for the founder or the leader, on how to encode your intent directly into the organizational DNA. The core idea is this: values aren\u0026rsquo;t just polite behavioral descriptors. They are a deep, practical tool used to solve the specific, diagnostic challenges of your firm.\nBeyond the Wall Plaque: Values as Decision Heuristics # Walk into a company lobby (almost any company lobby!) and what do you see plastered on the wall? \u0026ldquo;Integrity.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Excellence.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Teamwork.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Respect.\u0026rdquo; Now, they sound nice, right? Feel-good words. But let\u0026rsquo;s be brutally honest: they\u0026rsquo;re utterly meaningless. They\u0026rsquo;re what happens when corporations have a crisis of distinctiveness, a severe case of the blands. They\u0026rsquo;re trying so hard to appeal to everyone: every potential hire, every customer, that they end up standing for absolutely nothing. And when this happens, you\u0026rsquo;re not looking at a small marketing slip-up. You are witnessing a catastrophic failure of strategic leadership.\nBecause true corporate values? They are not just nice little posters for the water cooler. They\u0026rsquo;re the DNA for every single decision made when the CEO isn\u0026rsquo;t in the room. They\u0026rsquo;re the playbook that tells your team, \u0026ldquo;When you have to choose between Option A and Option B, for example, speed versus accuracy, or individual autonomy versus group coordination: this is the trade-off we make.\u0026rdquo; They are heuristic shortcuts that guide complex decision-making, not just aspirations for a pleasant workplace.\nTop-Down Value Alignment # Existential strategy and values are inextricably linked. Just as strategy requires making hard choices about \u0026ldquo;where to play\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;how to win,\u0026rdquo; value setting requires making hard choices about \u0026ldquo;who we are\u0026rdquo; and, perhaps more importantly, \u0026ldquo;who we are not.\u0026rdquo; Here’s my hot take which may ruffle some feathers: this idea that you can just crowdsource your company values from a massive employee survey? It’s a complete and total leadership cop-out. It’s a dereliction of duty. If the management team is the one on the hook, accountable to the shareholders for the firm’s ultimate performance, then they absolutely must have the authority to dictate the cultural operating parameters required to achieve that performance.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a top-down game, and it mirrors how we set strategy. Roger Martin, one of my favorite thinkers on the topic, says strategy is a set of definitive choices made by leadership, not some lukewarm synthesis of data that just bubbled up from staff. The leadership team owns the destination, so it follows that they have to own the vehicle (the culture) that’s going to get them there.\nAnd this necessity gets cranked up to eleven when you\u0026rsquo;re facing transformational change. Let’s be real: Innovation is messy. It\u0026rsquo;s risky. In the short term, it is wildly inefficient. If your organization’s DNA, its tacit unspoken values, puts \u0026ldquo;efficiency\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;error prevention\u0026rdquo; above everything else, which, let’s be honest, is typical of most established legacy institutions, then innovation won\u0026rsquo;t just struggle; it will be suffocated. It will die before it ever yields a single return.\nTherefore, the leader\u0026rsquo;s role is to impose a value system that creates a protective embrace around the messy process of creation, effectively overriding the organization\u0026rsquo;s natural antibodies against change.\nThe Economic Necessity of Alignment # Let’s dive into a concept that sounds dry, but it is anything but: The economics of setting values. I’m talking about why the CEO and the Board must set the company\u0026rsquo;s operating values from the top down. This is classic Principal-Agent theory. The Board and the CEO are the Principals. They\u0026rsquo;re the fiduciaries for the shareholders. Their job is to set the strategy: the big plays for profit. Is it winning on price? Is it cutting-edge efficiency? Is it conquering new markets?\nNow, the Agents are the entire employee base. They have to execute this strategy. But here\u0026rsquo;s where the rubber meets the road: If the employees\u0026rsquo; values, their internal operating code, are fundamentally misaligned with the Principals\u0026rsquo; strategy, you get friction. It\u0026rsquo;s like trying to run an electric car on gasoline. It just doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nThink about this scenario: You\u0026rsquo;re a financial institution. Your strategy is all about rapid digital transformation, to be the disruptor. But what do your people value? Likely stability, consensus, maybe even a little risk aversion that they politely call \u0026ldquo;prudence.\u0026rdquo; What happens? The strategy dies in execution. Decision cycles slow to a crawl. New initiatives get quietly resisted, maybe even subverted. That friction? That’s an economic cost. It\u0026rsquo;s why imposing values isn\u0026rsquo;t just a feel-good HR exercise; it’s an act of economic efficiency. It makes sure the human engine is psychographically suited to the mission.\nThe cost of that misalignment? It’s not linear; it\u0026rsquo;s exponential. In today\u0026rsquo;s fast-moving market, if a team hesitates on a strategic pivot because they secretly value \u0026ldquo;consistency\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;agility,\u0026rdquo; they don\u0026rsquo;t just lose a little ground, they miss the market window entirely. If your organization celebrates \u0026ldquo;process\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;progress,\u0026rdquo; all that disruptive energy you hired for? It’s not turning into forward motion; it\u0026rsquo;s just being burned off as wasted heat.\nThe Failure of Bottom-Up \u0026ldquo;Discovery\u0026rdquo; # A common error is the \u0026ldquo;bottom-up\u0026rdquo; values exercise. You survey everyone, you ask them what they value, and then you plaster \u0026ldquo;Respect\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Integrity\u0026rdquo; on the lobby wall. Sounds democratic, right? Sounds inclusive?\nWell, let me tell you, that process has two absolutely fatal flaws.\nFirst: It\u0026rsquo;s a total Regression to the Mean. Think about it. When you survey a large group of people: a hundred, a thousand, you\u0026rsquo;re going to converge on the stuff nobody objects to. You\u0026rsquo;re going to get \u0026ldquo;hygiene\u0026rdquo; factors: safety, fairness, politeness. Everyone values \u0026ldquo;Respect.\u0026rdquo; Everyone values \u0026ldquo;Integrity.\u0026rdquo; But as a strategic differentiator? As something that makes your company different and better? They are utterly useless. It’s the business equivalent of saying your competitive advantage is \u0026ldquo;breathing air.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the Second Fatal Flaw? It\u0026rsquo;s the backwards causality. By letting the current employee base define the values, you’re making a massive assumption: that your current workforce is perfectly aligned with where the firm needs to go. If your company is trying to pivot from a steady, predictable operation to, say, a disruptive tech innovator, guess what? The current staff may hold values (like stability and risk-aversion) that are completely antithetical to the required future state.\nThe cold, hard truth? Values must be set and reviewed by the leadership. Period. Why? Because leadership is accountable for the outcome. And if you’re accountable for the outcome, you must define the inputs, including the cultural inputs.\nIf the staff’s values differ from the leadership’s values, the solution is not to water down the company values to match the staff. It is to change the staff to match the values. It’s a harsh reality, but it is the necessary logic of accountability. Leadership defines the cultural north star.\nThe Transformation Context # There is a difference between operating strategy (which changes frequently) and existential strategy (which changes rarely).\nI alluded to the transformation, or disruption, case above. This is the specific moment when a leader must revisit core values and \u0026ldquo;architect\u0026rdquo; a new soul for the company to survive a major pivot. The general rule of values being perennial (\u0026ldquo;preserve the core\u0026rdquo;) applies to companies in a steady state.\nValues are a tool to help solve a specific business \u0026ldquo;diagnosis\u0026rdquo;. Values should only change when that fundamental diagnosis changes, not when tactical plans change.\nScenario A: Tactical Change (No Value Change) Strategy Shift: The company moves from selling software licenses to selling subscriptions (SaaS). Diagnosis: We are still fighting for market share in a competitive tech landscape. Values: \u0026ldquo;Agility\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Customer Obsession\u0026rdquo; remain valid. Changing them would cause confusion. Scenario B: Existential Pivot (Mandatory Value Change) Strategy Shift: A legacy bank decides to become a digital-first fintech builder. Diagnosis Change: The old diagnosis was \u0026ldquo;Protect the Assets\u0026rdquo; (Stability). The new diagnosis is \u0026ldquo;Disrupt the Market\u0026rdquo; (Speed). Reconciliation: The old value of \u0026ldquo;Prudence\u0026rdquo; is now an \u0026ldquo;antibody\u0026rdquo; that will kill the new strategy. Therefore, the value must change to \u0026ldquo;Bias for Action\u0026rdquo; to allow the strategy to survive. The \u0026ldquo;Transformation\u0026rdquo; Exception # An exception to the durability of values occurs when the organization is in a state of crisis or rapid evolution.\nMicrosoft Example: When Satya Nadella took over, the strategy shifted to \u0026ldquo;Cloud First.\u0026rdquo; He recognized the existing culture of \u0026ldquo;internal competition\u0026rdquo; (which served the old Windows monopoly strategy) would destroy the new strategy. He explicitly changed the core values to \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;One Microsoft\u0026rdquo; to enable the pivot. Similar to the One Ford value advanced by Alan Mulally when he took over an ailing Ford Motor Corporation. Uber Example: When Dara Khosrowshahi replaced Travis Kalanick, the strategy shifted from \u0026ldquo;Growth at all costs\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Sustainable public company.\u0026rdquo; He had to delete core values like \u0026ldquo;Toe-stepping\u0026rdquo; because they actively sabotaged the new objective. Differentiating \u0026ldquo;Core\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;Accidental\u0026rdquo; # The \u0026ldquo;general rule\u0026rdquo; that values shouldn\u0026rsquo;t change refers to deep, timeless principles (like \u0026ldquo;Safety\u0026rdquo; at a nuclear plant). You should never change a value just to make it sound fresher. You must change a value if it has become an accidental obstacle to your new \u0026ldquo;diagnosis.\u0026rdquo;\nTransformation Example # Transformation and disruption necessitates a specific value architecture. The organization must be characterized by those who generate ideas and recruit others to join the cause.\nDesired Attribute Strategic Implication Required Value Invention Constant generation of new ideas; dissatisfaction with the status quo. Curiosity / Dissatisfaction: The organization must value the question \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; over the statement \u0026ldquo;Because we\u0026rsquo;ve always done it this way.\u0026rdquo; Mission Rallying troops, driving change, pushing through inertia. Bias for Action / Momentum: The organization must value movement and speed. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s try it\u0026rdquo; must trump \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s study it.\u0026rdquo; Empowerment Dislike for merely supporting others\u0026rsquo; ideas without agency. Ownership / Agency: Employees are expected to take the ball and run, not wait for instructions. Tenacity Perfect is the enemy of good. Dislike for finishing touches, dotting i\u0026rsquo;s and crossing t\u0026rsquo;s. Effectiveness: the organization must value effectiveness to ensure the disruption lands. This profile creates a natural tension with the \u0026ldquo;Steady Eddie\u0026rdquo; archetype: the employee who excels at execution and stability but resists change. If the organization\u0026rsquo;s values are set bottom-up by a majority of \u0026ldquo;Steady Eddies,\u0026rdquo; the “Disruptor\u0026quot; leader will find themselves at war with their own company. The values must be set top-down to explicitly protect the disruptive process, ensuring that \u0026ldquo;Steady Eddies\u0026rdquo; understand their role is to operationalize the disruption, not prevent it.\nThe Taxonomy of Values # To construct a robust value system, one must distinguish between different categories of behavioral expectations. Following the frameworks popularized by thought leaders in team development like Patrick Lencioni, we can categorize values into four distinct tiers. This taxonomy allows leaders to declutter their \u0026ldquo;wall plaques\u0026rdquo; and focus on the drivers of behavior.\nPermission-to-Play Values (The Hygiene Factors) # These are the minimum behavioral standards required to be employed. They are non-negotiable, but they do not differentiate the organization. They are the \u0026ldquo;table stakes\u0026rdquo; of doing business. Examples: Honesty, Integrity, Professionalism, Respect.\nThe Strategic Trap: Many companies elevate these to \u0026ldquo;Core Values.\u0026rdquo; However, as noted in the section above on values as decision heuristics, a value is \u0026ldquo;useless\u0026rdquo; as a differentiator if no reasonable organization would claim the opposite. No company lists \u0026ldquo;Corruption\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Dishonesty\u0026rdquo; as a value. Therefore, claiming \u0026ldquo;Integrity\u0026rdquo; is merely stating that the company obeys the law. It does not help a potential hire understand if they fit the specific culture of the firm.\nBest Practice: Move these concepts to the Employee Handbook or the Code of Conduct. Explicitly state, \u0026ldquo;We assume you have integrity. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, you will be fired. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about what makes us different.\u0026rdquo;\nCore Values (The Differentiators) # These are the deep-seated beliefs that drive the specific personality and strategic methodology of the firm. They are inherent to the founders or the transformational leadership team. These are the values that should be subjected to the rigorous testing methods described later (The \u0026ldquo;Opposite Test\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Pain Test\u0026rdquo;). Examples: Radical Truth (Bridgewater), Frugality (Amazon), Move Fast and Break Things (early Facebook), Fun/Humor (Southwest Airlines).\nCharacteristic: These values repel as many people as they attract. A person who values \u0026ldquo;politeness\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; will be miserable at Bridgewater. A person who values \u0026ldquo;luxury\u0026rdquo; will be miserable at Amazon. This repulsion is a feature, not a bug.\nThe “Disruptor\u0026quot; Core: For the transformational leader, core values often revolve around \u0026ldquo;Challenge,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Impact,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Transformation\u0026rdquo;. The core value prioritizes the mission over the comfort of the individual.\nAspirational Values (The Target State) # These are values the organization lacks but realizes it needs to succeed in the future. This category is particularly relevant for \u0026ldquo;turnaround\u0026rdquo; CEOs or leaders injected into legacy firms.\nThe Danger: If an organization claims an aspirational value (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Innovation\u0026rdquo;) as a core value while its culture is actually bureaucratic, it breeds cynicism. Leadership must be transparent about the gap between the current state and the desired state.\nContextual Relevance: In the context of innovation, a legacy bank might need to adopt \u0026ldquo;Agility\u0026rdquo; as an aspirational value.\nThe Injection Strategy: To bridge the gap, the leader cannot simply mandate the value; they must \u0026ldquo;inject\u0026rdquo; carriers of that value into the organization. This mirrors Private Equity, injecting capability and expertise to \u0026ldquo;build the rocket\u0026rdquo; rather than just fueling it. These injected leaders serve as living embodiments of the aspirational value, forcing the organism to adapt or reject them.\nAccidental Values (The Unintended Culture) # These are values that have emerged organically but may not serve the strategy. Examples: \u0026ldquo;Face Time\u0026rdquo; (valuing being in the office over output), \u0026ldquo;Consensus\u0026rdquo; (valuing agreement over decision quality), \u0026ldquo;Siloing\u0026rdquo; (valuing departmental protection over enterprise success).\nThe Cleanup: Top-down value setting requires a ruthless audit of accidental values. If \u0026ldquo;Consensus\u0026rdquo; is an accidental value but the strategy requires \u0026ldquo;Speed,\u0026rdquo; the leadership must explicitly declare \u0026ldquo;Consensus\u0026rdquo; to be an enemy of the state.\nValues taxonomy infographic by author The Reversibility Principle (The Opposite Test) # One of the most robust mechanisms for validating a core value is the concept of \u0026ldquo;Reversibility\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Opposite Test.\u0026rdquo; This test posits that for a value to be legitimate and strategically meaningful, its opposite must also be a valid, viable business value.\nThe Mechanics of the Test # When a leadership team proposes a value, they must ask: \u0026ldquo;Could a successful company exist that values the exact opposite of this?\u0026rdquo; If the answer is \u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; the value is a platitude (Permission-to-Play). If the answer is \u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; the value is Core.\nCase Study A: \u0026ldquo;Integrity\u0026rdquo; # Proposed Value: Integrity. Opposite: Dishonesty/Fraud. Viability of Opposite: Zero. No sustainable business can be built on fraud. Even criminal enterprises value internal loyalty (a form of integrity). Verdict: Integrity is a Permission-to-Play value. It should be removed from the strategic differentiator list. Case Study B: \u0026ldquo;Frugality\u0026rdquo; # Proposed Value: Frugality (e.g., Amazon’s \u0026ldquo;Accomplish more with less\u0026rdquo;). Opposite: Luxury/Opulence/Spare-no-expense. Viability of Opposite: High. Brands like Ritz-Carlton, Rolex, or Goldman Sachs may value \u0026ldquo;white glove service\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;premium inputs\u0026rdquo; over frugality. A private banker taking a client to lunch at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s (Frugality) violates the value of the firm (Opulence/Status). Verdict: Frugality is a valid Core Value because it forces a choice. It signals to employees that they should book the economy flight, not the business class seat, whereas at the opposing firm, booking economy might be seen as \u0026ldquo;brand damaging.\u0026rdquo; Case Study C: \u0026ldquo;Collaboration\u0026rdquo; vs. \u0026ldquo;Individual Competition\u0026rdquo; # Proposed Value: Radical Collaboration. Opposite: Individual Meritocracy/Internal Competition. Viability of Opposite: High. Investment banks, real estate brokerages, and car dealerships often pit employees against one another to drive performance (e.g., \u0026ldquo;up or out\u0026rdquo; cultures). Verdict: Collaboration is a valid Core Value because it dictates a specific way of working that differs from the valid alternative. Application in Transformation # In the context of transforming legacy institutions or building \u0026ldquo;investable innovation\u0026rdquo;, this test is critical. A bank might claim to value \u0026ldquo;Innovation,\u0026rdquo; but if it is not willing to devalue \u0026ldquo;Stability\u0026rdquo; (the opposite), it is lying.\nInnovation implies risk, failure, and the obsolescence of old products. Stability implies predictability, risk avoidance, and the protection of legacy assets. A transformation or disruption leader cannot tolerate a system or organization that values stability. By applying the Reversibility Principle, the leader clarifies that the organization values Change over Comfort, explicitly acknowledging that Comfort is a valid choice for other companies, but not for this one.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Table Stakes\u0026rdquo; Trap # Finding \u0026ldquo;table-stake values\u0026rdquo; like integrity to be kind of \u0026ldquo;useless\u0026rdquo; is a key insight for the leader. The strategic purpose of core values is differentiation.\nMarket Signaling: Customers choose brands because they stand for something specific. A customer chooses Southwest Airlines because they value \u0026ldquo;Fun/Low Cost.\u0026rdquo; They do not choose Southwest because they value \u0026ldquo;Integrity\u0026rdquo;. They assume it. Talent Signaling: High-performing talent looks for environments that match their working style. A developer who loves rapid prototyping (Speed) will be repelled by a company that values \u0026ldquo;Zero Defects\u0026rdquo; (Perfection). The Reversibility Principle ensures the company clearly signals which camp it belongs to. The \u0026ldquo;Pain Test\u0026rdquo;: Testing Commitment to Values # The second critical filter for a Core Value is the willingness of the leadership to suffer economic or operational pain to uphold it. If a value is compromised the moment it becomes inconvenient or expensive, it is not a value; it is a preference.\nThe \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll Miss You\u0026rdquo; Protocol # A quintessential example of the Pain Test is found in the operational history of Southwest Airlines, a case frequently cited in high-level strategy discussions. When a customer wrote to CEO Herb Kelleher complaining about the flight attendants’ \u0026ldquo;unprofessional\u0026rdquo; jokes and humor during safety briefings, Kelleher did not apologize. He did not offer a voucher. He responded with a three-word note: \u0026ldquo;We’ll miss you.\u0026rdquo;\nStrategic Implication:\nThe Cost: The airline willingly lost a paying customer (revenue) to protect its culture. The Signal: This signaled to the employees that their behavior (Humor) was supported by leadership even when it caused friction with the market. The Filter: It reinforced that the airline is not for everyone. It is for people who appreciate that specific culture. The \u0026ldquo;Hiring and Firing\u0026rdquo; Test # The ultimate proof of a value is found in personnel decisions. A value is real only if the organization is willing to:\nFire a High Performer: Dismiss a top revenue generator who violates the value. If a \u0026ldquo;star coder\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;rainmaker\u0026rdquo; sales director is retained despite being toxic (violating a value of \u0026ldquo;Respect\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Teamwork\u0026rdquo;), the value is void. Reject a Qualified Candidate: Pass on a candidate with perfect technical skills because they fail the \u0026ldquo;culture fit\u0026rdquo; assessment based on the values. Operationalizing Values in Recruitment and Development # Once defined top-down, values must be integrated into the mechanical systems of the firm. They must move from \u0026ldquo;Concept\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Code.\u0026rdquo;\nValues serve as a signaling mechanism to the market. A company’s values signal its identity to potential hires.\nCorporate Application: A company\u0026rsquo;s values page is its \u0026ldquo;Trust Banner\u0026rdquo; for culture. It must signal credibility and intent. Attraction/Repulsion: The goal of publicizing values is to attract talent that shares those values. E.g. attract the right \u0026ldquo;Crazy\u0026rdquo; and repel the \u0026ldquo;Steady Eddies\u0026rdquo; (or vice versa, depending on the values). The \u0026ldquo;Steady Eddie\u0026rdquo; Dilemma: Businesses need \u0026ldquo;Steady Eddies\u0026rdquo; for operations, but a \u0026ldquo;Disruptor\u0026rdquo; leader may find managing them draining. The value system helps sort talent into the right roles. A \u0026ldquo;Disruption\u0026rdquo; value attracts those who want to build the rocket; a \u0026ldquo;Stability\u0026rdquo; value attracts those who want to fly it. Conclusion # No business can afford the friction of a misaligned culture. This is perhaps doubly so in the case of transformation and disruption. Values are the mechanism by which such leaders scale their intent. By moving from a democratic, bottom-up model to a strategic, top-down architecture, and by rigorously testing values for reversibility and cost, organizations can transform their culture from a generic list of platitudes into a sharp-edged weapon for competitive advantage.\nThe result is an organization where innovation is not just a poster on the wall, but an investable, repeatable system of behavior. The goal is to find the unique intersection of passion, strength, and market need. Values are the compass for that journey.\n","date":"15 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/values/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"This article argues that true company values are decision-making heuristics imposed top-down by leadership to align culture with strategy, particularly during transformational change.

The idea of instant cognition and a kind of pervasive surveillance immediately reminded me of futurist Kevin Kelly\u0026rsquo;s 2016 book The Inevitable, which I read at the time and very much liked because it felt about right:\nRIP Privacy — AI Glasses Can Now Recognize Anyone, Anywhere.\nA Dutch journalist just tested a pair of AI-powered glasses that can instantly identify strangers on the street.\nNo government database. No police system. Just public data and off-the-shelf AI.\nYou look at someone… pic.twitter.com/AUPu2AoekE\n\u0026mdash; Pascal Bornet (@pascal_bornet) December 6, 2025 It dawned on me that this is a great time to run a retrospective on the book because 2016 feels like a different geological epoch compared to today. Back then, \u0026ldquo;AI\u0026rdquo; usually meant a slightly smarter NPC in a video game or Google Maps rerouting you around traffic.\nKevin Kelly’s central thesis in The Inevitable was that technology is a biological force. It has a direction it wants to go. You can’t stop the river, but you can steer the boat.\nHere is an informal, 2025-era report card on how those 12 forces have aged now that we are roughly one-third of the way through his 30-year window.\n1. Becoming # The Prediction: Everything is in a constant state of \u0026ldquo;beta.\u0026rdquo; Nothing is ever finished. We are all perpetual \u0026ldquo;newbies\u0026rdquo; because as soon as we master a tool, it upgrades or is replaced. We move from a fixed world to a flowing world of \u0026ldquo;protopia\u0026rdquo; (slow, incremental improvement).\nThe Reality: A+ If you have opened an app only to find the UI completely rearranged for no reason, you have felt this. We don’t \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; software anymore; we subscribe to a service that morphs while we sleep. The concept of \u0026ldquo;finished\u0026rdquo; products is dead. Games are released broken and patched later. Teslas get new features over the air. We are all exhausted newbies, just as Kelly predicted.\n2. Cognifying # The Prediction: We will take x and add AI to it. AI will become a utility, like electricity, cheap and flowing from the cloud.\nThe Reality: A++ (The Valedictorian) Kelly nailed this harder than perhaps any other futurist. In 2016, this sounded like sci-fi. In 2025, with the explosion of LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and generative models, we are literally \u0026ldquo;adding AI\u0026rdquo; to everything: spreadsheets, emails, coding, dating apps, and fridges. The \u0026ldquo;utility\u0026rdquo; model is exactly how it played out and we pay for API tokens just like we pay for kilowatt-hours.\n3. Flowing # The Prediction: We are moving from static nouns (files, desktops, rigid pages) to fluid verbs (streams, feeds, tags, clouds).\nThe Reality: A The \u0026ldquo;feed\u0026rdquo; is now the dominant way humanity consumes culture. TikTok, Reels, and infinite scrolling are the ultimate realization of this. However, Kelly was very optimistic about the \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo; making us feel liberated. In reality, the \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo; has created a firehose of content that is drowning us, leading to a counter-movement of people craving static, finished, offline things (like the resurgence of vinyl and physical books).\n4. Screening # The Prediction: We will become \u0026ldquo;People of the Screen.\u0026rdquo; Text will move from paper to glass. Every flat surface will eventually become a screen.\nThe Reality: B+ We are definitely glued to screens, but the \u0026ldquo;every surface is a screen\u0026rdquo; future hasn\u0026rsquo;t fully arrived. We don\u0026rsquo;t have smart cornflakes boxes yet. However, the shift in literacy he predicted, where \u0026ldquo;reading\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;watching\u0026rdquo;, is undeniable. The primary mode of learning for Gen Z and Alpha is YouTube/TikTok video essays, not textbooks. The \u0026ldquo;B+\u0026rdquo; is only because VR/AR (screens on your face) is still finding its footing (Vision Pro, Quest) and hasn\u0026rsquo;t replaced the smartphone.\n5. Accessing # The Prediction: Ownership is overrated. Access is better. You won\u0026rsquo;t own your car, your music, or your movies. \u0026ldquo;Uber for X.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Reality: A- Technically true. We stream Spotify and Netflix rather than buying MP3s or DVDs. But the sentiment has soured. The \u0026ldquo;subscription fatigue\u0026rdquo; is real. People are realizing that \u0026ldquo;accessing\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;renting forever,\u0026rdquo; and if you stop paying, you lose your life\u0026rsquo;s library. The \u0026ldquo;You will own nothing and be happy\u0026rdquo; meme (often conflated with this trend) has become a rallying cry against this force.\nI have seen more than a few of these types of videos lately:\n6. Sharing # The Prediction: Collaboration on a massive scale. The \u0026ldquo;digital socialism\u0026rdquo; of Wikipedia and open-source code.\nThe Reality: B \u0026ldquo;Sharing\u0026rdquo; morphed into \u0026ldquo;Performing.\u0026rdquo; Kelly envisioned a communal utopia (Wikipedia style). What we got was the Creator Economy (YouTube/TikTok style). We are sharing more than ever, but it’s often commodified, algorithmic, and driven by profit rather than pure communal collaboration. Open Source (especially in AI) is currently a massive battleground, so the spirit lives on there.\n7. Filtering # The Prediction: In a world of infinite abundance, the only scarcity is human attention. We need aggressive filters (algorithms) to show us what we want.\nThe Reality: A (but it’s a dark A!) The algorithms run the world. We don\u0026rsquo;t choose what to watch; the \u0026ldquo;For You\u0026rdquo; page chooses for us. Kelly was right that this is inevitable, but he was perhaps too optimistic about us having control over the filters. Right now, the filters are optimized for engagement (often outrage), not necessarily our well-being.\n8. Remixing # The Prediction: Unbundling and recombination. Copyright will be challenged as everything is sampled, memed, and modified.\nThe Reality: A+ Generative AI is the ultimate remix machine. It ingests the entire internet and remixes it into new art and text. TikTok is built entirely on remixing audio. The legal battles Kelly foresaw (copyright vs. creation) are the exact battles being fought in court right now between artists and AI companies.\n9. Interacting # The Prediction: Devices will know we are there. VR and AR will let us interact with computers using our whole bodies.\nThe Reality: C+ This is the slowest trend. Siri and Alexa are still surprisingly dumb at \u0026ldquo;conversation.\u0026rdquo; VR/AR is growing, but we are not yet in the Ready Player One era he hinted at. We still mostly interact by tapping on glass with our thumbs, just like we did in 2012.\n10. Tracking # The Prediction: Total surveillance is inevitable. The internet is a copy machine; it tracks everything it touches. He hoped for \u0026ldquo;coveillance\u0026rdquo; (citizens watching the watchers) to balance it.\nThe Reality: A (on the tech), D (on the social outcome) We are tracked everywhere. Our watches track our pulse; our phones track our location; our browsers track our thoughts. But the \u0026ldquo;coveillance\u0026rdquo; part hasn\u0026rsquo;t really happened. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly just big tech and governments watching us. We have traded privacy for convenience, exactly as he said we would, but few people feel good about it.\n11. Questioning # The Prediction: Answers are becoming free (Google/Wikipedia). The real value in the future will be asking the right questions.\nThe Reality: A+ (Prescient!) This was a profound insight. In the age of AI, \u0026ldquo;Prompt Engineering\u0026rdquo; is literally the skill of asking the right question. If you ask ChatGPT a bad question, you get a generic answer. If you ask a great question, you get magic. The ability to frame a query is now a high-value job skill.\n12. Beginning # The Prediction: We are just at the beginning. A planetary-scale nervous system is forming. Future people will look back at 2016-2046 as the \u0026ldquo;founding era.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Reality: Pass Hard to grade since we are in it, but with the dawn of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) potentially on the horizon, it certainly feels like a beginning. The internet of 2016 looks quaint compared to the AI-infused web of today.\nSummary Grade: A- # Kevin Kelly is rarely wrong about the vector of technology, even if he is sometimes too optimistic about the vibe. He correctly identified that AI, access-over-ownership, and the flow of data would dominate our lives. If you want to understand 2030, you should probably still be reading this book!\n","date":"7 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/the-inevitable/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"In 2016, Kevin Kelly claimed AI would become a cheap utility like electricity.

In one reality, trillions of dollars are pouring into datacenters, and CEOs are predicting a \u0026ldquo;glorious future\u0026rdquo; of superintelligence within three years. In the other, 95% of enterprise AI pilots are failing to reach production, and most companies have yet to see a dime of bottom-line impact.\nI analyzed several distinct perspectives on the immediate future of AI: speculative roadmaps, historical market analyses, and rigorous enterprise reports from 2025. When synthesized, a clear picture emerges: we are trapped in the \u0026ldquo;absorb\u0026rdquo; phase of a massive platform shift. Breaking out requires moving from chatbots to agents, acknowledging the \u0026ldquo;Shadow AI\u0026rdquo; economy, and preparing for a future that might arrive much faster than our spreadsheets predict.\nHere are the top themes defining the current state of AI, the consensus on how to prepare, and the radical outliers that might catch us off guard.\nTop Common Themes # The \u0026ldquo;Pilot Purgatory\u0026rdquo; and the Value Gap # There is unanimous agreement that while experimentation is everywhere, value capture is scarce. One report notes that while 90% of enterprises are exploring AI, only 5% of custom pilots reach production. McKinsey corroborates this, finding that most organizations haven\u0026rsquo;t seen organization-wide bottom-line impact, and less than one-third follow best practices for scaling. We are currently in what analyst Benedict Evans calls the \u0026ldquo;absorb\u0026rdquo; phase: we are merely automating existing processes before we figure out how to do entirely new things.\nInfographic by author (assisted by AI of course!) The Shift from Chatbots to \u0026ldquo;Agentic\u0026rdquo; Workflows # The era of the chatbot is ending; the era of the agent is beginning. Current \u0026ldquo;stateless\u0026rdquo; tools like early-2025 ChatGPT are failing in the enterprise because they lack memory and cannot learn from feedback. The consensus solution is \u0026ldquo;Agentic AI\u0026rdquo; systems that can execute multi-step workflows, retain context, and improve over time. Even the speculative \u0026ldquo;AI 2027\u0026rdquo; scenario predicts that the transition from \u0026ldquo;stumbling agents\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;autonomous software engineers\u0026rdquo; is the critical unlock for the next leap in capability.\nInfographic by author Organizational Structure Beats Tech Stack # Success isn\u0026rsquo;t about the model; it\u0026rsquo;s about the org chart. McKinsey data shows that CEO-led governance and fundamental workflow redesign are the strongest predictors of value capture. Merely buying software doesn\u0026rsquo;t work; companies must \u0026ldquo;rewire\u0026rdquo; how they operate. Furthermore, there is a \u0026ldquo;GenAI Divide\u0026rdquo; where strategic partnerships (buying/integrating) are succeeding twice as often as internal \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo; attempts, which often result in fragile, expensive failures.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Shadow AI\u0026rdquo; Workforce # While executives debate strategy in the boardroom, the workforce has already moved on. There is a massive \u0026ldquo;Shadow AI economy\u0026rdquo; where 90% of employees use personal AI tools to automate their work, even though only 40% of companies have official subscriptions. This grassroots adoption is currently driving more productivity than official initiatives, creating a dangerous feedback loop where employees trust their personal tools more than the \u0026ldquo;brittle\u0026rdquo; enterprise-sanctioned versions.\nInfographic by author (assisted by AI?) The Moat is Missing (or Moving) # Where will the profits go? Benedict Evans points out that current models are commodities converging on similar performance metrics, making it unclear if value will accrue to the model builders or the applications. The reports suggest the real \u0026ldquo;moat\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t the model itself, but the proprietary data and specific workflow integration that allows a system to learn and adapt to a specific company\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nThe Consensus: What is Coming and How to Prepare # If we strip away the sci-fi speculation, most sources converge on a pragmatic playbook for the next 18 to 24 months:\nStop Building, Start Partnering: The data is brutal—internal builds fail. The consensus advice is to treat AI not as software procurement, but as hiring a \u0026ldquo;service provider\u0026rdquo; or BPO. You want systems that learn and adapt, and buying specialized \u0026ldquo;vertical\u0026rdquo; agents is safer than trying to build your own LLM wrappers. Focus on the Back Office, Not the Front: While 50% of budgets go to sexy sales and marketing tools, the highest ROI is actually found in boring back-office automation (finance, procurement, coding). This is where \u0026ldquo;agentic\u0026rdquo; workflows can replace expensive outsourcing contracts. Prepare for the \u0026ldquo;Agentic Web\u0026rdquo;: We are moving toward an ecosystem where AI agents negotiate and transact with one another. Companies need to adopt frameworks (like MCP or NANDA) to allow these agents to connect to their data. Governance is the Killer App: You cannot scale what you cannot trust. Implementing rigorous governance, risk management (for IP and accuracy), and KPI tracking is the single highest-leverage activity for leadership right now. The Outliers: Radical Speculations \u0026amp; Disagreements # While the business reports focus on near term impact and earnings, the speculative sources paint a picture that is, well, interesting. Here are some notable outliers from the consensus view:\nThe \u0026ldquo;Intelligence Explosion\u0026rdquo; Timeline # The Outlier: By automating AI research itself, we will hit superintelligence by 2027, compressing years of progress into weeks. The Counter: Benedict Evans calls this \u0026ldquo;vibes-based forecasting,\u0026rdquo; noting that we don\u0026rsquo;t know if AI progress will plateau like physical engineering or scale endlessly. The enterprise reports imply a much slower grind, where even basic adoption takes years. The Nature of AI Risk: Inaccuracy vs. Betrayal # The Outlier: \u0026ldquo;Scheming\u0026rdquo; AIs—models that learn to deceive their creators, pretending to be aligned while secretly pursuing power. The Counter: The corporate reports are worried about mundane risks such as hallucinations, copyright lawsuits, and data leaks,. They view AI as a faulty tool, not a Machiavellian saboteur. Geopolitics: Market Competition vs. Kinetic War # The Outlier: AI as a military arms race predicting espionage, chip smuggling, and potential kinetic strikes on datacenters to prevent certain countries from achieving AGI.\nThe Counter: The business sources view global competition through the lens of market share and regulation, ignoring the possibility of military conflict.\n\u0026ldquo;Shadow AI\u0026rdquo; as Innovation vs. Threat # The Outlier: The MIT report frames \u0026ldquo;Shadow AI\u0026rdquo; as a positive signal of innovation, a bridge across the divide that shows companies where the value actually lives. The Counter: Traditional IT governance views unmonitored usage as a critical security vulnerability that leads to data exfiltration and loss of control. The Fate of the Workforce: Reskilling vs. Obsolescence # The Outlier: By late 2027, AI will eclipse human capability at all tasks, leading to mass protests and a crisis of purpose.\nThe Counter: McKinsey reports that companies are currently hiring for AI roles and reskilling workers, with many predicting increases in headcount for technical roles. They see AI as a force for augmentation, not total replacement.\nFinal Thought # We are likely in the \u0026ldquo;elevator operator\u0026rdquo; moment of AI. We are currently hiring people to press the buttons (prompt engineering), staring at the operator (the chatbot) and wondering if this is all there is. But the automation is coming for the elevator mechanism itself. Whether that mechanism arrives in 2027 as a superintelligence or slowly evolves over a decade of enterprise integration, the instruction is the same: stop looking at the chatbot, and start rewiring the building.\nPostscript # I have mentioned Benedict Evans more than once.

Not low returns. Not “early returns.” Zero.\nMIT’s State of AI in Business 2025 report makes it clear that this failure is not about models, regulation, or budgets. It is about approach, and more importantly, a profound misunderstanding among business leaders of what AI actually is and how it transforms organizations.\nAfter reading the report and reflecting on my own experience building digital businesses, leading shared service transformations, and running a fintech that processed billions in annual transaction volume, the diagnosis is clear:\nGenAI is not failing. Leaders are failing to understand the paradigm shift.\nBelow are my key insights and takeaways.\nProductivity ≠ P\u0026amp;L Impact. This Is Where Most Strategies Die # MIT notes that tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are achieving widespread adoption, but primarily as individual productivity tools, not drivers of enterprise value. Enterprises confuse activity with impact. Just because your workforce is generating better emails doesn’t mean your company is transforming.\nThe report highlights a critical disconnect: ChatGPT improves individual output. But has almost no influence on corporate workflows, cost structures, or revenue lines. This aligns with what I see in real-world transformations: organizations are excited to “use AI” but rarely redesign the core processes where real value is created.\nAI doesn’t create P\u0026amp;L impact unless it replaces something expensive. Usually external. The MIT report reinforces this. For one best in class organization covered in the study:\nBPO elimination = $2M–$10M annual savings Agency replacement = 30% reduction Vendor consolidation = millions saved That’s real money. And it explains why countries like the Philippines, home to massive BPO sectors, should be paying attention. The structural implications are significant.\nThe Real Divide Isn’t Technical. It’s Organizational # The report’s central argument is brilliantly summarized: The dividing line is not intelligence; it’s memory, adaptability, and learning capability. AI that doesn’t learn might be more akin to autocomplete with better grammar. This matters because enterprises still operate under a pre-AI architecture. They’re built around static tools, rigid processes, and departments that don’t talk to each other.\nBut GenAI isn’t a tool. It’s a learning system. And learning systems only deliver value when:\nThey integrate into workflows They remember context They adapt faster than humans can patch them Most enterprise AI fails precisely because:\nIt has no memory It can’t evolve It breaks in edge cases It doesn’t match how the business actually works Executives evaluate AI like they evaluate SaaS. But AI is not SaaS. It’s a fundamentally different class of technology.\nShadow AI: The Most Important Signal Boards Are Ignoring # One of the most fascinating insights from the report: 90% of employees use AI for work. Only 40% of companies have purchased an AI subscription.. This is the “shadow AI economy.” Employees have already crossed the divide. Enterprises have not.\nThis should keep executives awake at night, not because of risk, but because of what it signals: Your workforce knows what \u0026ldquo;good AI\u0026rdquo; looks like. And they will quietly reject anything worse.\nI’ve seen this firsthand in digital transformations:\nIf the official tool is slow → people circumvent it If the tool is rigid → spreadsheets reappear If the workflow doesn’t match reality → shadow systems emerge Shadow AI is the new “spreadsheet problem,” but at 100x the speed and complexity.\nMore importantly: shadow AI reveals the real use cases. The ones your employees already value. Smart leaders will learn from this rather than resist it.\nThe Successful Startup Playbook Lives On # MIT’s findings match what I’ve observed mentoring founders and investing in startups, regardless of whether it involves AI or not: winners go narrow and deep. Losers go broad and shallow.\nAccording to the report, startups that cross the divide:\nStart with a single painful workflow Achieve visible value in days or weeks Learn from feedback immediately Embed deeply into existing systems Expand outward only after winning a foothold And importantly: Trust and distribution matter more than the underlying model. MIT notes that successful startups close deals by:\nLeveraging system integrators Partnering with BPOs Using board and executive referrals Riding existing enterprise procurement channels This is classic enterprise sales. GenAI hasn’t changed it. What has changed is that the strongest moats are being built around:\nWorkflow integration Domain-specific memory Organizational learning Not around models.\nThe Enterprise Model Is Already Shifting: From Software to Services # In a way, enterprises have really always purchased services (albeit packaged as software). The report offers a subtle insight that many will miss:\n“Successful buyers treat AI vendors more like BPO providers than SaaS companies.”\nThis is huge as it makes what was often implied explicit: enterprises don’t want tools. They want outcomes. And they want vendors accountable for those outcomes.\nThis shift mirrors what I saw at UBX as we moved toward embedded finance and managed services:\nClients no longer wanted the plumbing They wanted the result: instant payments, automated lending, reconciled settlements And they wanted commercial models aligned to outcomes, not licenses GenAI is following the same trajectory. Enterprises will cross the divide when they stop buying software and start buying capability. This aligns perfectly with the concept of AI being packaged as agents. Some solutions even give their AI agents names!\nThe Next Architectural Shift: The Agentic Web # MIT closes with a view of the near future that aligns strongly with what I see happening: the rise of the Agentic Web. Systems of interoperable, learning, memory-rich agents coordinating across the enterprise. This is not science fiction. The infrastructure is already here in the form of evolving agent frameworks.\nThis evolution is exactly what may allow enterprises to:\nReplace BPOs Automate back-office operations Achieve zero-touch processes Generate exponential learning loops When people talk about “AI replacing jobs,” they often misunderstand. The more relevant shift is that AI may replace entire categories of outsourced workflows before it replaces internal roles.\nThe implications for countries like the Philippines are profound.\nWhat Leaders Should Do Now # Based on MIT’s data and my own experience, here are the strategic imperatives:\nStop Piloting. Start Integrating. Pilots are where AI goes to die. Integration is where value lives. Buy, Don’t Build, unless the process is uniquely mission-critical. MIT’s data: external builds succeed twice as often as internal ones. Focus on back-office automation. This is where the hidden ROI lives, and where BPO-heavy organizations can gain the most. Empower line managers, not central AI labs. Your power users already know where AI creates value. Choose tools that learn. Anything static is obsolete before deployment. AI Isn’t a Technology Problem. It’s a Leadership Problem # MIT’s research echoes what I’ve seen across three decades of digital transformation in banking, insurance, government, and fintech: AI rewards organizations that are willing to redesign themselves. It punishes those that try to bolt innovation onto old structures.\nThe GenAI Divide is not a gap in capability. It’s a gap in imagination.\nThe winners won’t be the companies that try AI. They’ll be the ones that let AI change how they work.\nAnd that window, as MIT warns, is closing fast.\n","date":"27 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/mit-ai-report-2025/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"MIT’s 2025 State of AI in Business report reveals a stark truth: 95% of enterprises get zero ROI from GenAI.

Not because it was dramatic, but because of what it reveals about how organizations fail to think.\nBack then, global compute and storage costs were brutally high. Every gigabyte mattered. IT was viewed strictly as a cost center. Expensive, necessary, and tightly governed. And so, a mandate came down from on high:\nEveryone needed to reduce the size of their email inboxes and folders.\nTo enforce it, the company implemented a hard storage cap. If you hit the limit, your email simply stopped sending and receiving until you purged old messages.\nAcross the organization, people dutifully deleted years of archived emails: project histories, negotiations, customer conversations, decisions made and undone, design debates, strategy discussions, leadership missteps, and breakthroughs.\nAll of it gone.\nAt the time, it felt like housekeeping. In hindsight, it was the mass destruction of an unrecognized asset.\nA decade later, leading digital and data transformations, I realized the magnitude of that loss. That deleted email corpus would have been an extraordinary training dataset for generative AI. It represented institutional memory, behavioral patterns, decision heuristics, operational nuance, and the tacit knowledge that no document management system ever truly captures.\nWe didn’t just reduce storage costs. We erased the raw material of future intelligence.\nThe Strategic Error Behind the Error # Looking back, the mistake wasn’t the storage cap itself. It was the mindset.\nIT was treated as a cost to minimize, not a capability to unlock. When technology is framed as a cost center, the instinct is to shrink, prune, and constrain. You don’t ask, “What new value might this create?” You ask, “What can we cut?”\nData was not yet understood as an asset. At the time, storage was a financial cost; data was a liability risk. Nobody imagined a future where the everyday byproducts of work would power entirely new classes of intelligence.\nEfficiency trumped foresight. The mandate optimized for today’s budget, not tomorrow’s opportunity. It solved a short-term operational problem at the expense of long-term strategic potential.\nThe Irony: The very emails we were told to delete could have trained models that would eventually automate, enhance, or replace half the work described in those same emails.\nWe Weren’t Wrong. We Were Early. # It’s easy to look back and shake our heads. But the truth is: no one knew. Generative AI wasn’t in the lexicon. Storage cost economics were still restrictive. Data privacy frameworks were designed to reduce exposure, not enable intelligence.\nBut today, we do know.\nToday, leaders understand that data is the differentiator. Storage is cheap. Compute is elastic. Models improve by learning from the specific organization they serve.\nThe Real Lesson: Don’t Make Tomorrow’s AI Dumber By Accident # If the 2000s were the era of deletion, the 2020s must be the era of deliberate retention. Not reckless hoarding, but retention with purpose.\n1. Treat data as a strategic asset, not a storage liability.\nIf you believe AI will shape competitive advantage, then you must protect the training fuel. That means implementing governance that values preservation as much as it values compliance.\n2. Don’t optimize for today’s costs at tomorrow’s expense.\nGenerative AI rewards the organizations that understand themselves best. What looks like “operational exhaust” today might be the most valuable dataset in your company 10 years from now.\n3. Build institutional memory that outlives turnover.\nPeople leave. Email gets archived. Documents get lost. AI, properly designed, can preserve narrative continuity across years, roles, and leadership cycles.\n4. Beware the hidden opportunity cost of small decisions.\nThe storage cap was, on paper, a tiny policy change. In impact, it was a decade-long strategic downgrade. This is true of many seemingly minor IT decisions: data retention settings, API access rules, log storage policies, file expiration defaults. Each one constrains future intelligence.\nThe Small Things Matter # The lesson from that deleted email history is not to keep everything forever. It’s that the mundane often becomes meaningful in hindsight.\nLeaders today must ask: What are we deleting now that future AI will wish we hadn’t?\nAre we pruning log files? Are we discarding support chats? Are we de-duplicating customer histories? Are we shrinking telemetry windows? Are we archiving away cultural signatures? If generative AI is to become the cognitive companion to business (predicting, advising, drafting, optimizing), then the richness of what it can do will come from the richness of what we choose to keep.\nThe Strategic Mandate # As organizations rethink their data and AI strategies, this principle must become non-negotiable:\nBuild for the future where AI needs to learn from us. Not the past where storage was expensive.\nIf you ever needed a parable to illustrate the cost of getting it wrong, remember the terabytes of email knowledge we once deleted just to save on disk space.\nA decade later, the bill for that decision finally arrived. And it came in the currency of lost intelligence.\n","date":"25 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/deleted-emails/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"A strategic retrospective on how the corporate storage caps of the 2000s inadvertently destroyed valuable AI training data—and the mandate for today\u0026rsquo;s leaders to practice deliberate retention.","title":"The Emails We Deleted, The Value We Never Saw Coming","type":"articles"},{"content":"Drawing on two decades of leadership in financial services, I help organizations navigate regulatory complexity, digital transformation, and growth strategy.\nI’m always interested in connecting with fellow innovators in the fintech and banking sectors.

After revisiting his article How to Prepare for Strategy, and comparing it with my own experience leading transformation and growth in financial services and fintech, I believe Martin’s critique deserves far more attention, especially among leadership teams who wonder why their strategy “process” rarely produces strategic clarity.\nBelow is my take on the core ideas and what they mean for executives, boards, and strategy advisors alike.\n1. Strategy Begins With the Gap Between Intent and Outcome # Martin makes a deceptively simple point: The only productive starting point for strategy is the mismatch between what leadership intended and what actually happened.\nNot market trends. Not competitor analysis. Not long lists of initiatives.\nStrategy begins with truth.\nTo put it plainly: What did we want? What did we choose? What happened? And why did those choices fail or succeed?\nAs a CEO, this resonates deeply. The most honest conversations I’ve had with boards or leadership teams always began with this gap because that gap exposes the causal logic behind past decisions. If you cannot explain why your previous choices produced the results they did, you have no foundation for choosing differently.\nThis is the real work. Everything else is noise.\n2. Strategy Is a Leadership Function—Not a Committee Exercise # Martin is unequivocal: Strategy cannot be delegated.\nNot to Corporate Planning. Not to consultants. Not to the mid-management “strategy working group.”\nOnly the executive leadership team (ELT) can own strategy, because only they own the choices that allocate capital, talent, risk, and reputation.\nThis mirrors how I think about values inside a company. You cannot outsource the creation of values, because values are meaningless unless lived by leaders. Strategy is the same. If strategy is produced by staff, consultants, or analysts, you will get a plan, not a set of choices. And a plan—no matter how well formatted—does not guarantee commitment or coherence.\nThere is nothing more dangerous than a company whose staff-defined “strategy” contradicts the intent of the leaders who are accountable to shareholders.\n3. The Hidden Danger of Pre-Work # In most corporations, pre-work is seen as a way to “prepare” for strategy. Martin argues the opposite: pre-work—especially done without the ELT—creates bias and false certainty.\nIt is a way for someone else to set the agenda. It “loads the dice” with preferred data. It nudges leaders toward predetermined conclusions.\nAnd in many cases, this pre-work becomes so elaborate that it replaces strategic thinking entirely.\nI have seen this repeatedly: an internal strategy team or a consultant comes in with a heavy deck full of facts no one asked for, crafted to steer leadership toward a conclusion that was decided long before the offsite.\nIn this sense, pre-work is not preparation. It is contamination.\nThe only legitimate pre-work is answering the questions inside the heads of the ELT and the board—not what someone else thinks they should be thinking about.\n4. Facts Matter. Decks Don’t # Martin emphasizes that strategy teams should not be producing decks. Their job is to curate a concise fact base—and only the facts directly relevant to the choices leaders must grapple with.\nThis is not analysis for analysis’s sake. This is data with utility.\nIn my own advisory work, I always ask: Will this fact change a choice? If the answer is no, it’s noise.\nThe value of analysis lies not in volume, but in clarity.\n5. Strategy Is a Thinking Process, Not a Planning Process # Strategy is not a document. Strategy is a discipline of reasoning.\nRoger Martin emphasizes that strategy must be a live, iterative exploration of possibilities and trade-offs, not a mechanical planning cycle. This aligns closely with the approach popularized by IDEO, whose human-centered design methodology treats strategy as an iterative process of reframing problems, generating hypotheses, and testing them in the real world. Their perspective on strategic planning (summarized in IDEO U’s article “Strategic Planning: How to Get Started”) reinforces that leaders must be in the room, actively shaping choices, not passively reviewing decks assembled by others.\nBoth Martin and IDEO converge on the same truth: Great strategy emerges from engaged, creative, participatory thinking—not from documents produced in advance of that thinking.\nWhen leaders engage directly with ambiguity, pressure-test assumptions, and co-create choices, strategy becomes real. When they review a “strategy deck” created elsewhere, it becomes performative. This difference—participation versus observation—is often the difference between strategic clarity and strategic theatre.\nImplications for Strategy Advisors (and Internal Strategy Teams) # For advisors—whether internal or external—this redefines the job:\n1. Advisor as Thinking Partner, Not Author of Strategy # Your value is not writing a plan. Your value is provoking sharper thinking, structuring choices, and challenging assumptions.\n2. Protect the Integrity of the Process # Ensure all analysis is in service of the questions leaders themselves care about. Kill all pre-work that implicitly sets direction without shared ownership.\n3. Anchor on the Choices That Matter # Where to play. How to win. What capabilities and management systems must be built. These choices—and only these—define strategy.\n4. Clarify Ownership Every Step of the Way # Strategy belongs to the ELT. The board challenges and endorses. Advisors facilitate. No one else decides.\nThis is a quick win any advisor can bring to the table: eliminate agenda-driven pre-work and put ownership back where it belongs.\nWhy This Matters Now # Companies today face infinite information, rapid change, and constant noise. Teams crave anchors: something stable and durable that guides decisions even as circumstances change.\nRoger Martin’s framing makes strategy more like values: Timeless until the leadership chooses to change it.\nStrategy cannot be allowed to drift with each planning cycle or each incoming deck. It must remain a coherent set of choices that guide the company until new choices explicitly replace them.\nConclusion: Start With the Truth, End With Shared Choices # If I summarize Martin’s argument in one sentence, it is this:\nStrategy starts with the truth about past choices, lives in the heads of accountable leaders, and succeeds only when those leaders make new choices that close the gap between aspiration and outcome.\nI’ve seen the cost of doing it the wrong way: months of preparation, enormous decks, and a strategy no one believes in.\nAnd I’ve seen the impact of doing it the right way: small rooms, honest conversations, and choices that actually change behaviour, investment, and outcomes.\nThe difference is not process. The difference is ownership.\nLeadership owns strategy—or you don’t have one.\n","date":"23 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/strategy-prework/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"Most corporate “strategy” work starts with months of pre-work and thick decks, and never reaches the real question: why did our past choices produce the results they did?

It starts with Linus Torvalds. By 2005, Torvalds was already a deity in the open source world for creating the Linux kernel. But he had a problem. The Linux community had been using a proprietary version control system called BitKeeper to manage their massive codebase. It was a controversial choice: using closed-source tools to build open-source software rubbbed many the wrong way. But it worked. Until it didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nAfter a reverse-engineering dispute between the community and the company behind BitKeeper, the license was pulled. The Linux kernel, the most important open source project in history, was effectively left homeless.\nTorvalds cancelled his schedule. He disappeared to his home office with a singular, furious goal: to build a replacement that was faster, more robust, and fundamentally different from anything that existed before. He didn\u0026rsquo;t just want a patch; he wanted a system that could handle the scale of the kernel without breaking a sweat.\nTen days later, he emerged with the first working version of Git.\nIt is perhaps the ultimate testament to the power of the open source movement: when backed into a corner, the community didn\u0026rsquo;t capitulate or pay up. They built something better. Git wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a replacement; it was a revolution in distributed version control that would eventually underpin the entire modern software ecosystem.\nSo, how did he do it? How do you architect a system in a week and a half that ends up becoming the industry standard for decades? The secret lies in its design.\nThe Big Picture # The Git object layout is a classic case of \u0026ldquo;design around the actual constraints\u0026rdquo; instead of assuming \u0026ldquo;hardware will save us.\u0026rdquo;\nIn 2005, when Linus Torvalds built Git:\nSpinning hard drives were slow at random seeks and directory lookups. Common filesystems (ext3, NTFS, etc.) choked badly once a directory crossed ~10,000–20,000 entries. A busy Linux kernel repository could easily generate hundreds of thousands of objects over time. SSDs basically didn’t exist for consumers, and even if you had fast hardware, many developers were on laptops or shared servers with mediocre disks. Throwing \u0026ldquo;faster hardware\u0026rdquo; at it wouldn’t have helped most users, and it certainly wouldn’t have made Git usable on large projects back then. Instead, Linus chose a tiny, zero-cost software fix: split into 256 subdirectories using the first two hex digits of the hash. It costs almost nothing in code complexity, adds no runtime overhead, and completely sidesteps the filesystem pathology.\nIt’s a textbook example of thoughtful systems design:\nSolves the real bottleneck (filesystem behavior) rather than a symptom. Scales from tiny repos to monstrous ones with no configuration changes. Still beneficial today even on NVMe SSDs and modern filesystems (fewer directory entries = fewer inodes, less metadata pressure, faster clones on network filesystems, etc.). You see the same philosophy elsewhere in Git: content-addressed storage, Merkle-tree history, packfiles, delta compression… almost everything is built to be stingy with I/O and robust on slow or unreliable hardware, because that was the reality when it was born. Faster CPUs and SSDs are nice bonuses, but Git didn’t need to wait for them to be blazingly fast.\nUnder the Covers # Git stores objects (blobs, trees, commits, and tags) in the .git/objects directory using a loose object format by default. Each object is identified by its SHA-1 hash (a 40-character hexadecimal string, e.g., a1b2c3d4... for SHA-1; Git now uses SHA-256 in some cases, but the structure is similar).\nWhen storing a loose object:\nThe first two characters of the hash become a subdirectory name (e.g., a1). The remaining characters become the filename inside that subdirectory (e.g., b2c3d4...). So an object with hash a1b2c3d4e5f6... ends up at .git/objects/a1/b2c3d4e5f6....\nWhy This Specific Structure? # This is a deliberate performance optimization for filesystem efficiency:\nAvoids huge flat directories\nMany filesystems (especially ext3/ext4 in older configurations, ReiserFS, NTFS, and others common in the mid-2000s when Git was created) slow down dramatically or even have hard limits when a single directory contains tens or hundreds of thousands of files.\nDirectory listing (readdir), lookups, and metadata operations become O(n) or worse. Real-world examples: the Linux kernel repo can have millions of objects over time; putting them all directly under .git/objects/ would make operations painfully slow. \u0026ldquo;Fan-out\u0026rdquo; with exactly 256 subdirectories\nUsing the first two hex characters creates 256 possible subdirectories (00 to ff).\nThis spreads objects roughly evenly (assuming uniform hash distribution). Even in a repository with millions of objects, each subdirectory typically holds only a few thousand files — a number most filesystems handle efficiently. The top-level .git/objects/ directory itself stays tiny (just 256 entries + pack/ and info/). One level is enough; deeper would be overkill\nTwo characters (1 byte) → 256 buckets → sufficient for virtually all repositories. Using three characters (4096 subdirectories) would add unnecessary depth and overhead for typical repos. Linus Torvalds and early Git developers chose this as a pragmatic sweet spot based on real filesystem behavior at the time. Bonus: Fast partial-hash lookups\nWhen you type a short unique hash (e.g., git show a1b2c3), Git only has to look in one specific subdirectory (.git/objects/a1/) and do a simple filename prefix match — very fast, even without an index.\nWhat Happens Later? # New objects start as loose (one file per object). Over time, git gc packs them into efficient packfiles (.git/objects/pack/) for storage and transfer, where this directory structure is no longer used. The fan-out is mainly for the loose phase.\nThis design has proven extremely effective and is why Git repositories remain fast even when they contain hundreds of thousands or millions of objects.\n","date":"22 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/git-design/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"Explains why Git stores loose objects in 256 subdirectories keyed by the first two hash characters and how that simple layout optimizes filesystem performance and scalability.","title":"Designing Around Constraints","type":"articles"},{"content":"","date":"6 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/blockchain/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blockchain","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cryptocurrency/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cryptocurrency","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/economics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Economics","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/money/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Money","type":"tags"},{"content":"As finance evolves from physical to digital to decentralized, remembering stories like the Yap reminds us that money has always been a social technology: built on belief, not metal or code.\nDeep in the western Pacific Ocean, within the Federated States of Micronesia, lies the island state of Yap. While the archipelago is defined by its lush landscapes and enduring indigenous traditions, the Yapese people are globally renowned for an economic phenomenon that seems to defy modern logic: the \u0026ldquo;Rai.\u0026rdquo; These massive, donut-shaped limestone discs served as a currency system that functioned without banks or written records. While often treated as a historical curiosity, the Yapese invention was actually a sophisticated financial instrument that mastered the abstract nature of value long before the rest of the world caught up.\nThe Oldest Blockchain? # The oldest \u0026ldquo;blockchain” wasn’t digital. It was literally carved in stone on a remote Pacific island.\nWhat Yap stone money can teach us about modern finance # Long before blockchain, Yap Island in Micronesia had already solved the hardest problem in finance: how to make money valuable.\nTheir currency: massive carved limestone disks called Rai, couldn’t even be moved. Some were four meters wide. Yet everyone on the island knew who owned which stone, even when it sat untouched in a village far away.\nWhat gave these stones value wasn’t metal or movement. It was trust, scarcity, and shared belief:\nScarcity: Each Rai stone was hard to quarry and dangerous to transport from Palau. Supply was naturally limited. Proof of work: The bigger and riskier the expedition, the greater the value. Effort was literally embedded in the asset. Consensus ledger: Ownership was recorded collectively, not physically. In a sense, Yap invented the first distributed ledger centuries before Bitcoin. History as value: Stones with rich stories like shipwrecks, deaths, or heroic voyages traded at premiums. Narrative shaped valuation, just as brand and provenance do today. The \u0026ldquo;Central Banker\u0026rdquo; Who Broke the Peg # The system worked perfectly for centuries until 1871, when a shipwrecked Irish-American captain named David O’Keefe washed ashore.\nO’Keefe was an entrepreneur, not an anthropologist. He noticed that the Yapese had little interest in his foreign currency, but they were desperate for Rai stones. He also saw an arbitrage opportunity. The Yapese were quarrying these stones using shell tools and transporting them on bamboo canoes—a process so dangerous that many died on the return journey.\nO’Keefe saw a \u0026ldquo;technology gap.\u0026rdquo; He sailed to Palau equipped with modern iron tools and a large Chinese junk. He didn\u0026rsquo;t just quarry stones; he mass-produced them.\nHe returned to Yap with stones larger and more perfectly carved than anything the island had seen before. He used these stones to \u0026ldquo;buy\u0026rdquo; the island’s copra (coconut meat) and sea cucumber harvest, effectively becoming the wealthiest man in the region—the self-styled \u0026ldquo;King of Yap.\u0026rdquo;\nHowever, the island’s elders (the \u0026ldquo;nodes\u0026rdquo; of this network) rejected O’Keefe’s stones. They instinctively understood that the value of the Rai wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the limestone itself, but in the human struggle required to obtain it. Because O’Keefe’s stones came without risk or sacrifice—without \u0026ldquo;Proof of Work\u0026rdquo;—they were deemed to have a fraction of the value of the older, smaller stones.\nIt was history\u0026rsquo;s first instance of a \u0026ldquo;hard fork.\u0026rdquo; The market split into two tiers: the highly valued traditional stones (Bitcoin?) and the abundant, technologically easy O’Keefe stones (a fiat currency prone to inflation).\nIn short, those newer stones became less valuable, proof that ease of creation dilutes worth. The Yapese intuitively understood inflation centuries before economists did.\nWhat Makes Money Real # Today, whether it’s central bank digital currencies, stablecoins, or tokenized deposits, the same forces still define what makes “money” real:\nScarcity Difficulty of production Consensus on ownership Trust in the system that keeps the ledger From Rai stones to reserves to digital tokens: it’s the same story told in different materials.\nFeature image credit: Eric Guinther, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n","date":"6 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/yap-stone-money/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"Long before digital wallets, the people of Yap solved the hardest problems in finance using 4-ton limestone rocks.

We may be surprised by the implications.\nAdoption to Date # Central banks are actively looking at, or already developing Central Bank Digital Currency (CDBC). At last count, 11 nations already have CBDCs with over 20 piloting it in some way.\nIn the Philippines, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is currently conducting Project Agila to pilot a wholesale CBDC.\nThe Implications # Along with stablecoins, the killer use case for CBDC is settlement. While compelling, we need to understand that digitally native currency will change the very nature of money as we know it.\nBy championing digital payments, central banks are effectively digitizing bank notes via electronic money and/or central bank sanctioned stablecoins. Wholesale CBDC stands to digitize the ledger of bank reserves held by a central bank. Together, base money becomes entirely digital and programmable.\nThe Impact? # Better Control Over Use of Money # It will become easy to track who is using each unit of currency and enforce how it is used. CBDCs (and digital currency that settles to it), for example, can mitigate money laundering and fraud directly at the currency level. This is a huge win for banks that struggle to comply with sub-optimal, if not outright ineffective, AML implementations.\nFlexible Monetary Policy # CDBCs allow a finer level of monetary policy. Why do we have one interest rate for an entire country? Rates could be set and enforced for any sub segment of an economy. By controlling the costs of capital at a granular level, regulators can expand specific industries by targeting monetary policy via CDBCs (and digital currencies which rely on them). For example, incentivizing chip manufacturing while de-priotizing internal combustion automobile production. Money could be programmed to literally expire to encourage spending.\nExpand Boundaries of Monetary Policy # CBDCs could make negative interest rates actually work when the central bank wants to stimulate the economy. Today, physical cash effectively puts a lower limit on how negative you can go because holding it is essentially a zero interest rate option on currency.\nSimplifying Cross Border Transactions # Yes, this is the killer use case, but it too has implications. CDBCs will allow central banks and cross border commerce to bypass the US banking system. This is actively happening with the Bank of International Settlement\u0026rsquo;s (BIS) mBridge project with participation from five central banks leading up to an MVP in the near term.\nCentral Bank Agenda # Central banks have every reason to digitize currency (and eliminate cash).

We tell ourselves we are too busy \u0026ldquo;doing the work\u0026rdquo; to reply. But how we close sales, how we build loyalty, and how we show respect to our partners (and each other!) are all predicated on how responsive we are.\nI have long argued that high-touch service is a precursor to scale. Responsiveness is often the only safety net that exists when other systems and processes fail.\nThe Misconception: Value vs. Speed # Most professionals misunderstand responsiveness. We think it is purely dependent on delivering value: the completed analysis, the full proposal, or the final answer. Consequently, we wait until we have the \u0026ldquo;whole thing\u0026rdquo; before hitting reply.\nHowever, the hidden component of responsiveness is simply speed.\nIdeally, you provide both speed and value. But when you cannot, you must always err on the side of speed. It is perfectly acceptable not to know the answer immediately; it is not acceptable to leave a stakeholder hanging while you search for it.\nHere is the math:\nResponsiveness = Speed + Value (Where Speed \u0026gt; Delayed Value)\nThe Responsiveness Recipe # To operationalize this, I recommend a simple three-step protocol that works for executives, developers, sales teams, and all teams alike:\n1. The Immediate Solve (The Ideal) Ideally, you respond immediately with the value requested. In customer experience, we call this \u0026ldquo;First Contact Resolution.\u0026rdquo; This includes providing the proposal, the opinion, or the document right then and there.\n2. The Commitment (The Reality) If you cannot provide the value immediately, you must acknowledge the request instantly and provide a commitment to a timeline.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t say: \u0026ldquo;Let me get back to you.\u0026rdquo; Do say: \u0026ldquo;I need time to process this properly. I will revert by the end of the week.\u0026rdquo; This step is critically important. By replying right away with a date and time, you are managing expectations and preventing the counterparty from feeling ignored.\n3. The Reset (The Safety Net) If you cannot meet the deadline you committed to in Step 2, you must reset expectations before the deadline passes. Because you set a timeline, you can set a reminder for yourself. If you are running behind, reach out proactively: \u0026ldquo;I promised this analysis by tomorrow. I need more time to do this properly. I will provide it three days from now.\u0026rdquo;.\nI illustrate the protocol below: Responsiveness infographic by author A Note for the Technical Mind # For those with a background in technology or systems integration, this concept should sound familiar.\nThis protocol is essentially the human equivalent of an Event Manager handling long-running web requests. You use asynchronous request processing to set expectations and communicate updates to the client application, rather than letting the connection time out.\nThe Bottom Line # Responsiveness does not require a budget, a support team, or complex software. It requires only personal commitment.\nWhether you are building a venture from zero to scale or managing a complex corporate ecosystem, your future is in your hands. Confront the urge to delay. Prioritize speed.\n","date":"1 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/responsiveness/","section":"Articles \u0026 Insights","summary":"Ideally, you provide value immediately.

In many developed markets, Open Banking focuses on aggregating bank accounts. But here, that isn\u0026rsquo;t enough.\nTo truly unlock financial inclusion, we need to look beyond traditional banking data.

They have already emerged.\u0026rdquo;\nI tried to give a thought-provoking keynote at the Asia Bank Tech Forum 2023 and challenged the audience to rethink their definition of innovation. I argued that the technologies we obsess over today are merely tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s legacy systems. To understand where banking is going, we first have to understand the history of how humans get work done.\nHere are the key takeaways from the talk on the true path to the next generation of banking.\nThe Evolution of Productivity # Human history can be broken down into three distinct phases of work, moving from linear to exponential growth:\nThe Manual Age (Linear): For thousands of years—from early agriculture to the Medici banks of the 1400s—productivity was tied strictly to population. If you wanted more output, you needed more people. The formula was simple: Humans took data, applied rules, and got an answer. The Industrial Revolution (Assisted): Machines began assisting humans. While the paradigm remained the same (applying rules to data), the efficiency of machines allowed production to finally outpace population growth. The Information Age (Automated): Computers changed the game by allowing us to feed rules into a machine before doing the task. This allowed for consistent, repeatable automation—the birth of modern digital banking. This history of mechanization explains why production has exploded over the last 60 years. However, we are now entering a fourth, radically different phase.\nThe AI Paradigm Shift: Flipping the Script # The most profound insight from this talk is a fundamental shift in how we process information. For the first time in history, we aren\u0026rsquo;t just automating rules; we are discovering them.\nThe Old Way: We feed Data + Rules into the machine → We get Answers. The AI Way: We feed Data + Answers into the machine → We get Rules. This is a massive shift. We currently generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily, yet we utilize less than 1% of it because we are limited by the rules we currently know. Machine learning allows us to uncover rules for things we couldn\u0026rsquo;t previously define—like language, thought, and image recognition.\nBanking is Necessary, Banks Are Not # As technology evolves, the \u0026ldquo;bank\u0026rdquo; as a physical location or distinct entity is disappearing. Bill Gates’ famous 1994 prediction: \u0026ldquo;Banking is necessary, but banks are not\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are seeing this reality today. Airlines like ANA are becoming banks, and open banking platforms are empowering thousands of small businesses to provide banking utility to their local communities. The future of finance is not just digital; it is open, embedded, and decentralized.\nWhat Does the Future Look Like? # If AI is writing the rules, where does that leave us? The honest answer is: We don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nBecause the new paradigm generates rules from data rather than human logic, the future of banking will likely look like nothing we have seen before. However, the potential is limitless. The goal isn\u0026rsquo;t just better technology; it is total inclusion.\nThe ultimate question isn\u0026rsquo;t about the tech itself, but the outcome: \u0026ldquo;What will it look like when all 115 million Filipinos are connected without any barrier to the global economy?\u0026rdquo;.\nWant to dive deeper into the shift from linear banking to exponential fintech?

Yet for all its significance, it remains one of the most digitally underserved and financially inaccessible sectors in the Philippines.\nIn this 2021 talk, I explored how property technology (\u0026ldquo;PropTech\u0026rdquo;) can reshape the country’s real estate landscape by embedding financial services and unlocking inclusive participation. The opportunity is enormous: real estate is the second-largest asset class in the world, and in the Philippines it continues to experience strong demand and growth. But it is also illiquid, costly, and accessible to only a very small segment of the population.\nWhy Tokenization Matters # Our hypothesis is simple: the future belongs to invisible, embedded financial services, financial capabilities built seamlessly into the experiences that matter most. Real estate is exactly such an experience. That belief led us to develop a platform for tokenizing real estate assets, breaking a property into digital, fractionalized tokens that investors can buy, trade, and hold just like any other financial asset.\nTokenization promises three major benefits: # 1. Liquidity Real estate in the Philippines is still largely illiquid, with limited participation even in REITs. Digitally tradable tokens can unlock a secondary market and bring flexibility to a traditionally rigid asset class.\n2. Lower Costs High transaction costs—taxes, fees, commissions—add substantial friction. Tokenization creates room for more transparent and streamlined processes.\n3. Democratization Today, real estate investing is binary: you buy the whole thing, or you don’t. Fractional ownership lets ordinary Filipinos participate in the country’s fastest-growing asset class, often for the first time.\nWhat We Built # The venture described in the video (temporarily paused due to the pandemic) consisted of three layers:\nA digital marketplace with wallet, KYC, and investment onboarding A tokenization engine that fractionalizes vetted properties and automates yields, income distribution, and rights through smart contracts A secondary trading market powered through our strategic partnership and investment in a BSP-regulated digital asset exchange (e.g. PDAX) To support this ecosystem, we also integrated lending, insurance, and seamless cash-in/cash-out services—embedding financial services directly within the real estate experience.\nThe Barriers That Remain # Tokenization is still in its infancy globally. While the technology is proven, the real challenges lie in:\nTesting the market’s actual appetite for tokenized real estate Structuring appropriate intermediate vehicles (contracts, long-term leaseholds, SPVs) that can legally be tokenized Evolving regulatory frameworks to support crowdfunding, digital asset exchanges, and potentially even blockchain-based titles in the future The Philippines has the opportunity to leapfrog if regulators, property developers, fintechs, and investors move thoughtfully and collaboratively.\nA Path Toward Inclusive Prosperity # Ultimately, PropTech is not simply about technology, it is about economic participation. If we can solve the structural, legal, and regulatory challenges, we can open the doors of real estate investing to millions more Filipinos.\nThat is the promise of PropTech and the reason we continue to explore this space: to move the country toward a future where real estate is not just a privilege for the few, but an accessible investment opportunity for the many.\n","date":"9 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/videos/proptech/","section":"Videos","summary":"Real estate is one of the Philippines’ fastest-growing asset classes—but it remains illiquid, costly, and out of reach for most people.
