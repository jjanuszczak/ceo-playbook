After revisiting his article How to Prepare for Strategy, and comparing it with my own experience leading transformation and growth in financial services and fintech, I believe Martin’s critique deserves far more attention, especially among leadership teams who wonder why their strategy “process” rarely produces strategic clarity.\nBelow is my take on the core ideas and what they mean for executives, boards, and strategy advisors alike.\n1. Strategy Begins With the Gap Between Intent and Outcome # Martin makes a deceptively simple point: The only productive starting point for strategy is the mismatch between what leadership intended and what actually happened.\nNot market trends. Not competitor analysis. Not long lists of initiatives.\nStrategy begins with truth.\nTo put it plainly: What did we want? What did we choose? What happened? And why did those choices fail or succeed?\nAs a CEO, this resonates deeply. The most honest conversations I’ve had with boards or leadership teams always began with this gap because that gap exposes the causal logic behind past decisions. If you cannot explain why your previous choices produced the results they did, you have no foundation for choosing differently.\nThis is the real work. Everything else is noise.\n2. Strategy Is a Leadership Function—Not a Committee Exercise # Martin is unequivocal: Strategy cannot be delegated.\nNot to Corporate Planning. Not to consultants. Not to the mid-management “strategy working group.”\nOnly the executive leadership team (ELT) can own strategy, because only they own the choices that allocate capital, talent, risk, and reputation.\nThis mirrors how I think about values inside a company. You cannot outsource the creation of values, because values are meaningless unless lived by leaders. Strategy is the same. If strategy is produced by staff, consultants, or analysts, you will get a plan, not a set of choices. And a plan—no matter how well formatted—does not guarantee commitment or coherence.\nThere is nothing more dangerous than a company whose staff-defined “strategy” contradicts the intent of the leaders who are accountable to shareholders.\n3. The Hidden Danger of Pre-Work # In most corporations, pre-work is seen as a way to “prepare” for strategy. Martin argues the opposite: pre-work—especially done without the ELT—creates bias and false certainty.\nIt is a way for someone else to set the agenda. It “loads the dice” with preferred data. It nudges leaders toward predetermined conclusions.\nAnd in many cases, this pre-work becomes so elaborate that it replaces strategic thinking entirely.\nI have seen this repeatedly: an internal strategy team or a consultant comes in with a heavy deck full of facts no one asked for, crafted to steer leadership toward a conclusion that was decided long before the offsite.\nIn this sense, pre-work is not preparation. It is contamination.\nThe only legitimate pre-work is answering the questions inside the heads of the ELT and the board—not what someone else thinks they should be thinking about.\n4. Facts Matter. Decks Don’t # Martin emphasizes that strategy teams should not be producing decks. Their job is to curate a concise fact base—and only the facts directly relevant to the choices leaders must grapple with.\nThis is not analysis for analysis’s sake. This is data with utility.\nIn my own advisory work, I always ask: Will this fact change a choice? If the answer is no, it’s noise.\nThe value of analysis lies not in volume, but in clarity.\n5. Strategy Is a Thinking Process, Not a Planning Process # Strategy is not a document. Strategy is a discipline of reasoning.\nRoger Martin emphasizes that strategy must be a live, iterative exploration of possibilities and trade-offs, not a mechanical planning cycle. This aligns closely with the approach popularized by IDEO, whose human-centered design methodology treats strategy as an iterative process of reframing problems, generating hypotheses, and testing them in the real world. Their perspective on strategic planning (summarized in IDEO U’s article “Strategic Planning: How to Get Started”) reinforces that leaders must be in the room, actively shaping choices, not passively reviewing decks assembled by others.\nBoth Martin and IDEO converge on the same truth: Great strategy emerges from engaged, creative, participatory thinking—not from documents produced in advance of that thinking.\nWhen leaders engage directly with ambiguity, pressure-test assumptions, and co-create choices, strategy becomes real. When they review a “strategy deck” created elsewhere, it becomes performative. This difference—participation versus observation—is often the difference between strategic clarity and strategic theatre.\nImplications for Strategy Advisors (and Internal Strategy Teams) # For advisors—whether internal or external—this redefines the job:\n1. Advisor as Thinking Partner, Not Author of Strategy # Your value is not writing a plan. Your value is provoking sharper thinking, structuring choices, and challenging assumptions.\n2. Protect the Integrity of the Process # Ensure all analysis is in service of the questions leaders themselves care about. Kill all pre-work that implicitly sets direction without shared ownership.\n3. Anchor on the Choices That Matter # Where to play. How to win. What capabilities and management systems must be built. These choices—and only these—define strategy.\n4. Clarify Ownership Every Step of the Way # Strategy belongs to the ELT. The board challenges and endorses. Advisors facilitate. No one else decides.\nThis is a quick win any advisor can bring to the table: eliminate agenda-driven pre-work and put ownership back where it belongs.\nWhy This Matters Now # Companies today face infinite information, rapid change, and constant noise. Teams crave anchors: something stable and durable that guides decisions even as circumstances change.\nRoger Martin’s framing makes strategy more like values: Timeless until the leadership chooses to change it.\nStrategy cannot be allowed to drift with each planning cycle or each incoming deck. It must remain a coherent set of choices that guide the company until new choices explicitly replace them.\nConclusion: Start With the Truth, End With Shared Choices # If I summarize Martin’s argument in one sentence, it is this:\nStrategy starts with the truth about past choices, lives in the heads of accountable leaders, and succeeds only when those leaders make new choices that close the gap between aspiration and outcome.\nI’ve seen the cost of doing it the wrong way: months of preparation, enormous decks, and a strategy no one believes in.\nAnd I’ve seen the impact of doing it the right way: small rooms, honest conversations, and choices that actually change behaviour, investment, and outcomes.\nThe difference is not process. The difference is ownership.\nLeadership owns strategy—or you don’t have one.\n","date":"23 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/strategy-prework/","section":"Articles","summary":"Most corporate “strategy” work starts with months of pre-work and thick decks, and never reaches the real question: why did our past choices produce the results they did?

Common filesystems (ext3, NTFS, etc.) choked badly once a directory crossed ~10,000–20,000 entries. A busy Linux kernel repository could easily generate hundreds of thousands of objects over time. SSDs basically didn’t exist for consumers, and even if you had fast hardware, many developers were on laptops or shared servers with mediocre disks. Throwing \u0026ldquo;faster hardware\u0026rdquo; at it wouldn’t have helped most users, and it certainly wouldn’t have made Git usable on large projects back then. Instead, Linus chose a tiny, zero-cost software fix: split into 256 subdirectories using the first two hex digits of the hash. It costs almost nothing in code complexity, adds no runtime overhead, and completely sidesteps the filesystem pathology.\nIt’s a textbook example of thoughtful systems design:\nSolves the real bottleneck (filesystem behavior) rather than a symptom. Scales from tiny repos to monstrous ones with no configuration changes. Still beneficial today even on NVMe SSDs and modern filesystems (fewer directory entries = fewer inodes, less metadata pressure, faster clones on network filesystems, etc.). You see the same philosophy elsewhere in Git: content-addressed storage, Merkle-tree history, packfiles, delta compression… almost everything is built to be stingy with I/O and robust on slow or unreliable hardware, because that was the reality when it was born. Faster CPUs and SSDs are nice bonuses, but Git didn’t need to wait for them to be blazingly fast.\nUnder the Covers # Git stores objects (blobs, trees, commits, and tags) in the .git/objects directory using a loose object format by default. Each object is identified by its SHA-1 hash (a 40-character hexadecimal string, e.g., a1b2c3d4... for SHA-1; Git now uses SHA-256 in some cases, but the structure is similar).\nWhen storing a loose object:\nThe first two characters of the hash become a subdirectory name (e.g., a1). The remaining characters become the filename inside that subdirectory (e.g., b2c3d4...). So an object with hash a1b2c3d4e5f6... ends up at .git/objects/a1/b2c3d4e5f6....\nWhy This Specific Structure? # This is a deliberate performance optimization for filesystem efficiency:\nAvoids huge flat directories\nMany filesystems (especially ext3/ext4 in older configurations, ReiserFS, NTFS, and others common in the mid-2000s when Git was created) slow down dramatically or even have hard limits when a single directory contains tens or hundreds of thousands of files.\nDirectory listing (readdir), lookups, and metadata operations become O(n) or worse. Real-world examples: the Linux kernel repo can have millions of objects over time; putting them all directly under .git/objects/ would make operations painfully slow. \u0026ldquo;Fan-out\u0026rdquo; with exactly 256 subdirectories\nUsing the first two hex characters creates 256 possible subdirectories (00 to ff).\nThis spreads objects roughly evenly (assuming uniform hash distribution). Even in a repository with millions of objects, each subdirectory typically holds only a few thousand files — a number most filesystems handle efficiently. The top-level .git/objects/ directory itself stays tiny (just 256 entries + pack/ and info/). One level is enough; deeper would be overkill\nTwo characters (1 byte) → 256 buckets → sufficient for virtually all repositories. Using three characters (4096 subdirectories) would add unnecessary depth and overhead for typical repos. Linus Torvalds and early Git developers chose this as a pragmatic sweet spot based on real filesystem behavior at the time. Bonus: Fast partial-hash lookups\nWhen you type a short unique hash (e.g., git show a1b2c3), Git only has to look in one specific subdirectory (.git/objects/a1/) and do a simple filename prefix match — very fast, even without an index.\nWhat Happens Later? # New objects start as loose (one file per object). Over time, git gc packs them into efficient packfiles (.git/objects/pack/) for storage and transfer, where this directory structure is no longer used. The fan-out is mainly for the loose phase.\nThis design has proven extremely effective and is why Git repositories remain fast even when they contain hundreds of thousands or millions of objects.\n","date":"22 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/git-design/","section":"Articles","summary":"Explains why Git stores loose objects in 256 subdirectories keyed by the first two hash characters and how that simple layout optimizes filesystem performance and scalability.","title":"Designing Around Constraints","type":"articles"},{"content":"","date":"22 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/technology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ai/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"AI","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/banking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Banking","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/digital/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Digital","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/external/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"External","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cleantech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CleanTech","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/distributed-energy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Distributed Energy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/electric-vehicles/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Electric Vehicles","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/energy-transition/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Energy Transition","type":"tags"},{"content":"Incubation.

They have already emerged.\u0026rdquo;\nI tried to give a thought-provoking keynote at the Asia Bank Tech Forum 2023 and challenged the audience to rethink their definition of innovation. I argued that the technologies we obsess over today are merely tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s legacy systems. To understand where banking is going, we first have to understand the history of how humans get work done.\nHere are the key takeaways from the talk on the true path to the next generation of banking.\nThe Evolution of Productivity # Human history can be broken down into three distinct phases of work, moving from linear to exponential growth:\nThe Manual Age (Linear): For thousands of years—from early agriculture to the Medici banks of the 1400s—productivity was tied strictly to population. If you wanted more output, you needed more people. The formula was simple: Humans took data, applied rules, and got an answer. The Industrial Revolution (Assisted): Machines began assisting humans. While the paradigm remained the same (applying rules to data), the efficiency of machines allowed production to finally outpace population growth. The Information Age (Automated): Computers changed the game by allowing us to feed rules into a machine before doing the task. This allowed for consistent, repeatable automation—the birth of modern digital banking. This history of mechanization explains why production has exploded over the last 60 years. However, we are now entering a fourth, radically different phase.\nThe AI Paradigm Shift: Flipping the Script # The most profound insight from this talk is a fundamental shift in how we process information. For the first time in history, we aren\u0026rsquo;t just automating rules; we are discovering them.\nThe Old Way: We feed Data + Rules into the machine → We get Answers. The AI Way: We feed Data + Answers into the machine → We get Rules. This is a massive shift. We currently generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily, yet we utilize less than 1% of it because we are limited by the rules we currently know. Machine learning allows us to uncover rules for things we couldn\u0026rsquo;t previously define—like language, thought, and image recognition.\nBanking is Necessary, Banks Are Not # As technology evolves, the \u0026ldquo;bank\u0026rdquo; as a physical location or distinct entity is disappearing. Bill Gates’ famous 1994 prediction: \u0026ldquo;Banking is necessary, but banks are not\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are seeing this reality today. Airlines like ANA are becoming banks, and open banking platforms are empowering thousands of small businesses to provide banking utility to their local communities. The future of finance is not just digital; it is open, embedded, and decentralized.\nWhat Does the Future Look Like? # If AI is writing the rules, where does that leave us? The honest answer is: We don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nBecause the new paradigm generates rules from data rather than human logic, the future of banking will likely look like nothing we have seen before. However, the potential is limitless. The goal isn\u0026rsquo;t just better technology; it is total inclusion.\nThe ultimate question isn\u0026rsquo;t about the tech itself, but the outcome: \u0026ldquo;What will it look like when all 115 million Filipinos are connected without any barrier to the global economy?\u0026rdquo;.\nWant to dive deeper into the shift from linear banking to exponential fintech?
