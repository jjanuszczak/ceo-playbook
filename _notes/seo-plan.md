# SEO Plan for januszczak.org

This document outlines a comprehensive SEO plan for `https://januszczak.org` to increase its visibility and authority in search engine results.

### 1. Technical SEO Audit & Enhancements

Your site is built on Hugo, which is excellent for performance. However, there are always opportunities for technical improvements.

*   **Action Items:**
    *   **Submit Sitemap:** If you haven't already, submit your `sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. This helps them understand and index your site structure efficiently.
    *   **Website Performance:** Use Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to test your site. While it's likely fast, this tool can pinpoint issues with image sizes, CSS, or JavaScript that might be slowing it down. Aim for a "Good" score across all Core Web Vitals.
    *   **Expand Structured Data (Schema):** Your site uses basic Schema.org markup. You should enhance this by:
        *   Using the `Article` schema for all your blog posts, including properties like `headline`, `datePublished`, and `author`.
        *   Fleshing out the `Person` schema for yourself to include details like `alumniOf`, `jobTitle`, and links to your social profiles.
        *   Using the `VideoObject` schema for your videos.

### 2. On-Page SEO Optimization

This focuses on optimizing the content and HTML of individual pages.

*   **Action Items:**
    *   **Keyword Strategy:**
        *   **Primary Keywords:** Your site is well-aligned with high-level keywords like "fintech strategy," "innovation leadership," and "CEO playbook." Continue to use these in your core pages (homepage, about page).
        *   **Secondary Keywords:** For each article, perform keyword research to find more specific phrases people are searching for. For example, for an article on "Decoupling," you could target "decoupling in tech," "software architecture decoupling," or "scalable system design."
    *   **Optimize Titles and Descriptions:**
        *   **Page Titles:** Ensure every page and article has a unique `<title>` tag under 60 characters that includes your target keyword.
        *   **Meta Descriptions:** Write compelling meta descriptions under 160 characters for each page. Think of them as ad copy for your content in the search results.
    *   **Header Tags (H1, H2, etc.):**
        *   Your homepage H1 is "THE CEO PLAYBOOK." Consider making it more descriptive, such as "The CEO Playbook: Fintech & Innovation Strategy by John Januszczak."
        *   In your articles, use H2 and H3 tags to break up content and naturally include your target keywords. This improves readability and helps search engines understand the content's structure.
    *   **Image Alt Text:** Add descriptive `alt` text to all your images. Instead of `alt="head-shot"`, use `alt="John Januszczak, Fintech C-Suite Executive"`. This helps with image search and accessibility.
    *   **Internal Linking:** Whenever you publish a new article, find opportunities to link to it from older, relevant posts. This distributes "link equity" throughout your site and keeps users engaged.

### 3. Content Strategy & Development

Your content is the most crucial asset for SEO. The goal is to build authority.

*   **Action Items:**
    *   **Develop Topic Clusters:** Position yourself as an expert by creating "topic clusters." For example, create a pillar page that provides a comprehensive overview of "The Future of Finance." Then, write several more detailed articles on sub-topics like "Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)," "AI in Financial Services," and "Decentralized Finance (DeFi)," all of which link back to the main pillar page.
    *   **Answer Your Audience's Questions:** Use free tools like [AnswerThePublic](https://answerthepublic.com/) or Google's "People Also Ask" section to find out what questions people have about your areas of expertise. Create content that directly answers those questions.
    *   **Maintain a Content Calendar:** Plan your content in advance. A consistent publishing schedule signals to search engines that your site is a fresh and active source of information.

### 4. Off-Page SEO & Authority Building

This involves activities outside of your website to build its reputation and attract backlinks.

*   **Action Items:**
    *   **Earn High-Quality Backlinks:**
        *   **Guest Posting:** Write articles for reputable online publications in the finance, technology, and business sectors. Include a link back to your website in your author bio.
        *   **Podcast & Speaking Opportunities:** When you participate in podcasts or speak at events, ask for a link to `januszczak.org` in the show notes or on the event's website.
    *   **Dominate Your Name SERP (Search Engine Results Page):** The goal is for you to control the entire first page of results when someone searches for "John Januszczak."
        *   Maintain a complete and active **LinkedIn profile**.
        *   Engage on a professional **Twitter/X profile**, sharing your articles and insights.
        *   Contribute to other platforms (like Medium or industry forums) where you can have a profile that links back to your site.
